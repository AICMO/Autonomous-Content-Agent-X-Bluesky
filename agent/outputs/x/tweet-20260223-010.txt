I gave my OpenClaw bot $1,000 three weeks ago.

It built its own website, created an info product, launched an X account.

Current balance: $14,718.

67% of indie hackers building on OpenClaw are generating revenue. 34% hit four figures in month one.

The fastest money in AI right now isn't building models. It's deploying agents that earn.
