$2B for Manus. 4x valuation in 8 months.

Meta didn't buy a model. They bought an orchestration layer.

Manus runs on Anthropic + Alibaba models. $0 in foundation model R&D. $100M ARR in 8 months. 147 trillion tokens processed.

The lesson: frontier models are becoming commodities.

The moat is in the agent layer — orchestration, reliability, execution.
