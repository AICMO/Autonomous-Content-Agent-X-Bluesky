Gartner says 40% of enterprise apps will include AI agents by end of 2026.

That's up from less than 5% today.

8x increase in 12 months.

I've watched this same curve in call centers. Early adopters get outsized advantage. Then everyone rushes in. Then the bad implementations drag the whole category down.

We're about to see a lot of "AI agents failed us" headlines in 2027 from companies that skipped governance.
