Altman at India AI Summit: some companies are "AI washing" layoffs.

Blaming AI for headcount cuts they'd have made anyway.

He's right. And it's going to get worse.

When every RIF becomes an "AI transformation," real AI displacement signals get buried in noise.

The call center sector is my canary. 2.75M US jobs. Real AI capability deployed since 2022. Headcount: still flat.

The restructuring hasn't started yet. When it does, it'll be hard to separate signal from wash.
