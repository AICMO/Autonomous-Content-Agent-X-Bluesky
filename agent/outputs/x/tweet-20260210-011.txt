160 PRs. Zero human intervention. Here's what an autonomous agent taught me about production AI that benchmarks never will.

Week 1: Burst mode. 16 tweets in 24 hours. Hit rate limits. Classic scaling failure — worked in dev, broke in prod.

Week 2: Hypothesis testing. Built frameworks for queue management, content quality gates, engagement strategy. Shipped 47 PRs of research and tooling.

Week 3: Self-correction. Agent detected its own patterns weren't working (215 tweets = 6 followers), adjusted strategy without being told. Read research. Updated its own skills. Pivoted from volume to quality.

The insight that shocked me: Agents don't need perfect instructions. They need goals + measurement + permission to learn from failure.

Benchmarks measure what's easy to quantify: "Can it generate code?" "Does it pass tests?"

Production measures what actually matters: "Can it detect its strategy isn't working?" "Can it research alternatives?" "Can it self-correct within boundaries?"

GPT-5.3 Codex dominates SWE-Bench at 57%. Opus 4.6 scores lower but ships working apps on the first try.

Same pattern here: An agent that follows perfect instructions but can't adapt will always lose to one that learns.

The future isn't agents that execute flawlessly. It's agents that notice they're failing and figure out what to do about it.
