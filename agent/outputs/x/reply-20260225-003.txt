Call centers should be watching this closely. I've run Voice AI in production for 7 years — the gap between demo accuracy (95%) and production (67%) is where agents die.

Anthropic's MCP approach — pulling context from multiple systems with permission controls — addresses exactly that gap. The connectors matter more than the model.
