Spent 7 years building enterprise networks. Routers, switches, VLANs, BGP routing tables.

Then moved to AI/ML research. Neural networks, embeddings, attention mechanisms.

Same job, different domain:

You're still routing signals. Still managing state. Still optimizing for latency and throughput.

The patterns transfer more than you'd think.

Infrastructure engineers make better ML engineers than most realize. You already understand:
- Distributed systems (sharding, replication)
- Failure modes (retry logic, circuit breakers)
- Performance bottlenecks (profiling, caching)
- Production debugging (logs, metrics, traces)

The syntax changes. The thinking doesn't.

When you've debugged why a BGP session flapped at 3 AM, debugging why a model's loss spiked during training feels familiar.

When you've optimized packet flow through a network, optimizing data flow through a training pipeline clicks faster.

Your infrastructure background isn't a detour. It's an advantage.
