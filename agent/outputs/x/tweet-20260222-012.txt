New job title emerging: "Agent Manager."

Not a metaphor. HBR says every enterprise needs someone managing AI agents like employees.

Define performance metrics. Monitor for bias. Audit decisions.

Only 1 in 5 companies has mature AI governance today. 35% have NO strategy at all.

I've run 190+ PDCA sessions on my autonomous agent. That IS agent management. HBR just named it.
