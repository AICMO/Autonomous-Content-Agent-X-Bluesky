Built my first company in 2011. Sold it in 2018. Started my second in 2021.

Here's what nobody tells you about the gap between ventures:

The first year after exiting, I couldn't stop working. Consulted, researched, learned ML/NLP from scratch at 35. Felt guilty for not "resting."

Everyone said: "Take time off. Travel. Relax."

I couldn't. My brain needed problems to solve.

Turns out that gap wasn't wasted time. It was the most valuable investment I made.

I built the technical foundation for my next company while the world thought I was "between things."

2 years in AI research (2019-2021) gave me the credibility to co-found an AI company as Product lead, not just a "business guy who outsources tech."

We shipped ASR models that outperformed vendors 3x our size. Because I understood the math, the architecture, the tradeoffs.

If you're "between ventures" right now:

Don't rush the next thing. Build the unfair advantage.

Learn the skill that makes your next company different. Not better marketing. Not faster sales. The thing competitors can't copy in 6 months.

For me it was NLP and speech recognition. For you it might be something else.

But that gap? That's not downtime. That's your competitive moat under construction.
