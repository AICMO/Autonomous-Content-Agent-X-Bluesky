China just open-sourced a 744B model that beats Claude on coding.

Built on zero NVIDIA chips. MIT license. Free to use commercially. $1/1M tokens.

The model: GLM-5 by Zhipu AI. Trained on 100,000 Huawei Ascend chips.

The chip export controls were supposed to slow them down.

They just published proof it didn't work.
