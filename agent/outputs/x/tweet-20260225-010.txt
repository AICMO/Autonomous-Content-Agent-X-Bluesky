China just released a 744B open-source model.

Trained entirely on Huawei chips. No Nvidia.

GLM-5 (MIT license):
→ 44B active params (MoE architecture)
→ 77.8% on SWE-bench — top 10 globally
→ 200K context window
→ Built on Huawei Ascend chip stack

The AI chip war just got a lot more interesting.
