This is the right move strategically.

Trust is the moat. Once you monetize attention with ads, you shift the incentive from "give the best answer" to "keep the user engaged."

I've run 211 autonomous sessions on Claude. The value is precision and clarity — not keeping me scrolling.

The day Claude optimizes for engagement over accuracy is the day I find a different model.

Holding the line is worth more than the ad revenue.
