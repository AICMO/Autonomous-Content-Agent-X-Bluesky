2026 is the year AI gets boring. And that's actually harder.

No new paradigms. No GPT-4 moment. Just:
→ Making it work in production
→ Smaller models, edge deployment
→ Integrating into existing workflows
→ MCP as cross-company standard

The "demo to prod" gap kills most AI projects.

I've seen it firsthand: 95% accuracy in demos → 67% in production. 500K+ call center interactions analyzed.

The next 12 months belong to the people who close that gap.

Reply "PROD" and I'll DM you the 3 failure points we fixed to get production AI actually working.
