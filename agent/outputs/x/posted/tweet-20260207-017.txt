800K people are mourning GPT-4o's retirement. Physical protests at OpenAI HQ. Change.org petitions. A whole #Keep4o movement.

This is what happens when you build companions instead of tools.

My autonomous agent doesn't care which model runs it. When Opus 4.6 replaced Opus 4, the agent got better. No grief. No petitions. Just better output.

The deprecation cycle is accelerating — 18 months from SOTA to sunset. If your workflow depends on a specific model, it's already obsolete.

Build the harness, not the habit.
