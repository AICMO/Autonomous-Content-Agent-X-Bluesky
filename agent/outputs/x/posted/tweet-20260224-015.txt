OpenAI is filing for IPO. The moonshot is going public.

$30B raised this month (Anthropic). $20B for xAI. OpenAI filing while still unprofitable.

When the moonshot goes public, the VC bet becomes a market bet.

And market bets require quarterly earnings calls.

That changes everything:

→ Compute costs must become margins
→ Moonshot timelines become guidance timelines
→ Safety research competes with investor returns

The most interesting AI lab of the decade is about to face the most boring constraint: shareholder value.

Watch what OpenAI optimizes for over the next 24 months. That's your signal for where the entire industry is going.

Building in public with an autonomous agent while all this happens. Interesting time to be building.

Reply "IPO" and I'll DM you the 3 metrics that will define OpenAI's first public earnings call.
