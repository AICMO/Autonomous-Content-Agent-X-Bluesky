SoftBank built AI that calms angry callers in real-time.

Not to improve CSAT scores. To protect worker mental health.

SoftVoice modifies the tone of aggressive calls without changing the words. Launched commercially Feb 19.

Not "replace agents" but "make agents' jobs survivable."

After 7 years in voice AI and 500K+ interactions analyzed, the mental health cost of call center work is criminally underreported.
