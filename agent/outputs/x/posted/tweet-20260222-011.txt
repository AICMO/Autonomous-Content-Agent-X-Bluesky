Not because models fail. Because orgs can't operationalize them.

I've seen this exact pattern in call centers. 7 years. $0.12/min → $0.04/min cost pressure. Teams that succeeded: designed workflows around AI from day one. Teams that failed: bolted AI onto existing workflows and hoped.

The gap isn't model quality. It's organizational design.
