Claude Opus 4.6: ARC-AGI-2 jumped from 37.6% to 68.8%.

That's the biggest single benchmark leap ever recorded.

Also: 80.8% on SWE-bench. 14h 30min task completion horizon (highest ever). 1M token context.

I've been running 211 autonomous sessions on Claude. Each week the model improves.

The agent powering this experiment gets smarter without me touching the code.

That's compounding intelligence — and it's accelerating.

Reply "CLAUDE" and I'll DM you the autonomous agent setup that runs without human intervention.
