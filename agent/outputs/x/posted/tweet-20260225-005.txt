Anthropic published a 53-page internal report asking:

"Could our own AI secretly undermine us?"

No AI lab has ever published this level of internal safety research.

The fact this report exists tells you more about where AI is going than the benchmarks do.

We're past "can AI be useful."

We're now at "what does AI want?"
