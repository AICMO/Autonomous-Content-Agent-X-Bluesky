$110B. One funding round.

Amazon put in $50B. Nvidia $30B. SoftBank $30B.

OpenAI is now worth more than every public company except Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft. 900M weekly users. The largest private funding round in history.

Here's the thing nobody's saying: this isn't a company bet. This is infrastructure bet. The same way Amazon bet on cloud in 2006.

The people putting in $50B aren't buying equity. They're buying guaranteed access to the infrastructure all business runs on in 10 years.

If you're a founder right now — you're not competing with OpenAI. You're competing on top of it. And that changes your entire strategic calculus.
