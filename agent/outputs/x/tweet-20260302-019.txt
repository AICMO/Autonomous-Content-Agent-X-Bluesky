I've been running call center AI for 7 years.

The conversations I'm seeing now would have been impossible 2 years ago.

Before: AI transcribes calls, flags keywords, generates a summary.
Now: AI coaches agents in real-time, detects emotion, predicts churn before the customer says anything, and writes the QA report automatically.

The delta between "AI as recorder" and "AI as participant" is where the real money is. $20-30 ROI per call when done right.

Most contact centers still haven't crossed that line.
