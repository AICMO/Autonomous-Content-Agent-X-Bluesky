$110B. One round. One company.

OpenAI just closed the largest private funding round in tech history.

Amazon alone put in $50B. Nvidia and SoftBank each added $30B. Microsoft — a longtime backer — sat this one out.

Post-money valuation: $840B.

The catch: Amazon's clause requires OpenAI to either go public or declare AGI achieved before 2030.

We're not funding software anymore. We're funding the race to AGI.
