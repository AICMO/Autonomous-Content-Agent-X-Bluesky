2026 is "a year of reckoning for contact centers."

Here's what that actually means:

→ AI handles 50-70% of high-volume calls
→ Cost per contact drops 20-40%
→ Human agent roles shift: QA trainers, AI supervisors, upsell specialists

The 75% of call centers still in pilot hell? 2026 is their deadline.

The 25% that made it to production? They're about to widen the gap dramatically.

The reckoning isn't for AI. It's for organizations that waited.

I've been in this space 7 years. The laggards in 2026 face a different problem than early adopters did. The moat is being built right now.
