$1.5 trillion invested in AI.

Only 6% of companies report >5% EBIT improvement.

The ROI math doesn't close — and most CFOs haven't noticed yet.

Here's why:

95% accuracy in the demo. 67% in production.
Integration takes 6 months. AI tuning takes 2 weeks.
Change management fails 3x more often than the model.

The companies seeing ROI aren't using better AI. They're doing better implementation.

Call centers with human-in-loop + real-time coaching? 20% CSAT gains.
Call centers that bought AI and called it done? Worse than before.

The bottleneck was never the model.
