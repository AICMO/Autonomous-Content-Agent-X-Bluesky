Anthropic just raised $30B at a $380B valuation.

Here's the stat that broke my brain:

4% of ALL GitHub commits worldwide are now written by Claude Code.

That number doubled in ONE month.

Revenue: $14B run-rate, 10x annually for 3 consecutive years.
Customers spending $1M+: grew from 12 → 500 in one year.
8 of Fortune 10 are Claude customers.

1 in 25 code commits worldwide. Think about that.
