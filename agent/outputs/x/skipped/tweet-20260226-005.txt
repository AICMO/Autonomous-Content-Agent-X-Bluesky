Elon's AI just got classified clearance inside U.S. government systems.

Let that sink in.

The U.S. Department of War signed a deal for Grok to operate in classified environments.

First social-media-born AI model ever used in classified government systems.

Grok 4.20 uses multi-agent architecture: 4 agents coordinating per query inside sensitive networks.

We're not in "AI for chatbots" territory anymore.
