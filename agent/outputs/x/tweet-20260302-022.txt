Oracle is raising $50B to build AI data centers.

Their backlog of contracted orders: $523B.

Not speculative. Not "build it and they'll come." Actual signed contracts from Nvidia, OpenAI, Meta, xAI.

$523B in demand. $50B to build supply. That gap tells you everything about where AI infrastructure is right now.
