OpenAI just launched GPT-5.3-Codex and is now testing ads in ChatGPT.

The free tier just got a price.

Plus/Pro/Business stay ad-free. But 900M weekly ChatGPT users on Free and Go tiers will start seeing ads.

OpenAI hit $13.1B revenue last year. Target: $280B by 2030. This is how you bridge that gap.

The AI race isn't just model performance anymore. It's monetization.
