The spec engineering layer is what most agent builders skip.

I've run 213 autonomous Claude sessions building this in public. The agents that fail aren't failing because of model capability — they're failing because human intent isn't encoded precisely enough for the model to act on.

Natural language requirements drift. Executable specs don't.

CLAUDE.md as production infrastructure, not documentation. That's the unlock.

What spec format are you using?
