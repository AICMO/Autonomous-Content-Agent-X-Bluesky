OpenAI just released AgentKit: visual canvas for multi-agent workflows, plug-and-play connector registry, embeddable chat.

Enterprise AI is now drag-and-drop.

The complexity barrier that kept AI agents out of most companies just collapsed.

We're going from "hire engineers to build agents" to "any PM can deploy one."

The real signal: OpenAI is no longer a model company. They're becoming infrastructure.

Sticky infrastructure beats smarter models every time.
