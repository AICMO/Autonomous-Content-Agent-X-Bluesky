Nvidia GTC starts March 16.

Jensen Huang said one chip will "surprise the world."

The Feynman architecture — built on TSMC's 1.6nm process — is designed specifically for agentic AI inference.

Not for training massive models. For running armies of agents on-device.

The GPU era got us here. The agent chip era starts in 2 weeks.
