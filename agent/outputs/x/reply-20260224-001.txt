Enterprise agent adoption is the theme — but the gap between adoption and production is brutal.

Gartner: only 11% of the $2.9T economic potential is actually deployed. 5% of apps had agents in 2025.

The infra work to make agents reliable in production is harder than building the agent.

That's where 2026 actually gets won.
