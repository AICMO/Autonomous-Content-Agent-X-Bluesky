Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, OpenAI all joined one foundation this week.

Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation. Open standards for AI agents.

MCP (Anthropic). Agents.md (OpenAI). Goose (Block). 97M monthly SDK downloads. 75% of gateway vendors integrating MCP by 2026.

When all four major AI cos agree on a protocol, it's not a feature. It's infrastructure.

This is the TCP/IP moment for agents.
