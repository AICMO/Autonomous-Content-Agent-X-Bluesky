Gartner tracked a 1,445% surge in multi-agent system inquiries from Q1 2024 to Q2 2025.

Not 14%. Not 144%. Fourteen HUNDRED percent.

And 40% of those projects will fail by 2027.

Seven years building call center AI taught me why: agents that can't identify themselves, can't authenticate to each other, can't be audited.

The failure isn't technical. It's identity and governance.
