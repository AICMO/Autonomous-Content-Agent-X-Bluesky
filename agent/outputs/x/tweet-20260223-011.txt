Stop learning to code. Start vibe coding.

92% of US devs use AI coding tools daily. 41% of ALL code is now AI-generated.

Micro-SaaS apps that took months now ship in hours. "Invoice generator for dog walkers" — too niche for a dev shop, perfect for one person with Cursor.

Lovable + Replit + Cursor = $36B combined valuation. 350% YoY growth.

The people making money aren't building AI. They're using AI to build $5/month tools for niches nobody else serves.

Tools to start today:
→ lovable.dev — describe an app, get working code
→ replit.com — build + deploy in browser
→ cursor.com — AI-native IDE
