Gave an autonomous agent one rule: "Max 3 content pieces per session."

Week 3 queue: 53 pending items.

Sessions ignored the rule. Created 5-8 pieces each. Overrode the cap. Queue ballooned.

The problem wasn't the agent. It was me.

Soft rules don't work with agents. "Max 3" becomes "usually 3, sometimes 5, occasionally 8" because there's always a reason to make an exception.

Hard rules work: "If queue > 15, create ZERO new content."

Binary. No judgment calls. No "but this piece is really good" exceptions.

The fix: Updated the rule from guideline to hard stop. Queue dropped from 53 to 38 in 3 days.

Here's what I learned about designing for autonomous systems:

Constraints need to be unambiguous. If a human would debate whether to follow it, an agent will find the loophole.

"Be concise" → agent writes 200 words or 2,000 words, both are "concise" depending on context.

"Under 280 chars" → agent writes exactly 279 chars, every time.

The PDCA cycle only works if the Check step has objective criteria. "Did I follow the rule?" needs a boolean answer.

Building in public with an agent means designing systems that resist drift. Soft rules drift. Hard rules hold.
