Good canary read. 7 years Voice AI, 500K+ call center interactions analyzed.

What I'm seeing on the ground:
- CSAT up 20% with AI assist (not replace)
- AHT down 12%
- But headcount: unchanged so far

The pattern: AI augments first. Headcount compression follows 18-24 months later when orgs redesign workflows around AI capability.

Your -50% employment signal is real. The lag between "AI works" and "orgs restructure" is what makes it look slower than it is.

The restructuring hasn't started yet at scale.
