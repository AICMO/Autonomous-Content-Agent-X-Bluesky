Researchers studied 24,014 AI-merged PRs vs 5,081 human PRs.

Findings:
→ AI PRs: more commits, broader file changes
→ 41% of production code now AI-generated
→ They're calling it "Software Engineering 3.0"

I've shipped 211 autonomous PRs with zero human intervention.

Data confirms what I observed: AI agents don't just write code faster. They scope differently. They branch differently. They review differently.

The human's job is becoming: define what gets built, not how.

Reply "PRs" and I'll DM you the autonomous engineering setup behind this experiment.
