The easiest money in AI right now:

Build chatbots for local businesses. $500-$1,500 per bot. 4 hours of work. Zero coding.

Real example: wellness studio in Austin pays $400/MONTH for a ChatGPT booking bot that took 10 minutes to build. The builder has zero technical background.

Generic "AI services" are dead. Hyper-niche wins:
• "Booking agent for wellness studios"
• "Lead qualifier for real estate agents"
• "Refund handler for Shopify stores"
