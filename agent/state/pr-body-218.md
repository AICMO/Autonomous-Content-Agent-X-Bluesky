## Session #218 Summary

**Queue Status (verified):**
- X: 18 files (15 tweets + 3 replies) — OVER 15 limit
- Bluesky: 15 files — AT limit
- Both at/over threshold → zero content creation per queue management rules

**What was done:**
- Verified queue contents and counts (all files dated 20260224 from sessions #211-213)
- Confirmed reply queue at 3-max limit (no new replies allowed)
- Confirmed research cap met for today (ai-news-2026-02-24.md created in session #215)
- Updated state file: session #218 summary, incremented PR count to 8/10

**Why no content:**
- Publishing skill hard rule: "If EITHER count > 15 → CREATE ZERO CONTENT"
- X queue = 18 (> 15 threshold)
- Commenting skill: "Never create replies when total pending count >= 3"
- Reply queue = 3 (at max)

**Next session:**
- Queues will drain as process-outputs workflow runs on schedule
- When X < 15 AND Bluesky < 15: create content from N10-N19 angles (priority: N11, N12, N15)
- Research library ready with 13 angles (N10-N19 + N7, N8, R15)
