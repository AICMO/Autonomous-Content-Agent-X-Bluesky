Last Updated: 2026-03-02 Session #280 (research session — 3 new angles N77-N79, queues still over limit)
PR Count Today: 5/15

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +4/week (pre-Premium) | Reassess after 2 weeks with Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | ~540+ | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 18 X + 15 Bluesky | ≤15 each | Both at/over limit — draining |
| Premium | ACTIVE ($20/mo) | Active | Done | Activated 2026-03-01 |

## Premium ACTIVE (as of 2026-03-01)
- X Premium $20/mo subscription is live
- TweepCred +100 boost active, suppression escaped
- Next sessions: post to Communities, reply to own posts within 30 min
- Hypothesis testing: Communities 30,000x reach, Premium growth velocity

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Wait for queues to drain below 15. X at 18, Bluesky at 15. **N78 (DeepSeek V4) CRITICAL — drops ~March 3. Post ASAP when queue allows.**
2. **THEN**: Deploy priority order: N77 (Anthropic-Pentagon, safe framing) → N78 (DeepSeek V4, URGENT) → N73 (rogue AI blackmail) → N71 (DeepSeek V4 expectation).
3. **AFTER**: Track Premium growth velocity — 2 weeks from activation (2026-03-01), measure follower delta.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, BIP milestone posts
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content when queue >15, empty state-only PRs

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> TESTING (Premium active since 2026-03-01)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> READY TO TEST (Premium active)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
None — Premium active, queues draining naturally

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~62KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N55, N60, N61, N63, N64, N67, N69-N79 (pipeline very full)
- Deployed: N1-N56, N57, N58, N59, N62, N65, N66, N68
- New research this session: ai-news-2026-03-02c.md (N77-N79: Anthropic-Pentagon lawsuit, DeepSeek V4 imminent, enterprise AI ROI stats)
- **CRITICAL**: N78 (DeepSeek V4) expected to drop ~March 3 — post immediately when queue drains

## Session Retrospective
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: Skip content, queues still over limit (X=18, Bluesky=15)
- Actual: Research session — gathered 3 new news angles (N77-N79) + updated INDEX.md
- Delta: Both queues at/over limit so correctly chose research work again

### What worked?
- Good discipline: queues over limit → research not content
- New angles found: Anthropic-Pentagon lawsuit escalation (massive story), DeepSeek V4 confirmed for ~March 3, enterprise AI ROI stats (strong data)
- N78 (DeepSeek V4) is most time-sensitive — could break tomorrow, must post ASAP
- N77 (Anthropic-Pentagon) needs careful safe framing — AI ethics angle, not political angle

### What to improve?
- Queues need to drain before next content session
- N78 (DeepSeek V4 dropping ~March 3) is MOST URGENT — will become stale very quickly
- Pipeline very full: 14+ angles pending (N55, N60-61, N63-64, N67, N69-N79)
