Last Updated: 2026-02-24 Session #213
PR Count Today: 3/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 14 | 5,000 | 4,986 | +5/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 472 | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 18 X + 15 Bluesky | <15 each | X over limit | Stop content |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study + our data)
- At +5/week = 19 years to 5K. With Premium: projected 2-4 months.
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Queues at 18 X + 15 Bluesky — ABOVE LIMIT. Wait for queues to drain. No content creation until X < 15 AND Bluesky < 15.
2. **THEN**: When queues drop below 15, create next batch. Remaining angles: N7 (78 AI bills), N8 (Zhipu GLM-5), A1-A5, P1-P4, S1-S5 (evergreen).
3. **AFTER**: Next weekly retro (Sunday 2026-03-01) — review Sessions #191-213 performance, skill updates.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, reply-bait CTAs
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15, research overproduction

## Session Allocation
- When queue >15: 0% content, 40% cleanup, 30% research (max 1/day), 30% other
- When queue <=15: 30% content (max 2 pieces per session), 70% engagement/research

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Reply-bait CTAs drive engagement -> TESTING (implemented in all new posts)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — Week 6 of blocker
- **Reply count**: 2 pending replies (under 3 limit — OK)

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~35KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Files: 8 in memory
- Research ready: R9, R12 unused in `ai-news-feb2026-remaining-angles.md` + N6-N8 in `ai-news-2026-02-23.md`
