## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +5-7/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 516 | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 9 X + 15 Bluesky | <15 each | Bluesky at limit — no content creation | X under limit |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study + our data)
- At +5/week = 19 years to 5K. With Premium: projected 2-4 months.
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Deploy N35-N38 from ai-news-2026-02-26.md when Bluesky drains to <15 (Perplexity Model Council, Claude benchmarks, GPT-5.3 ads, MatX chips).
2. **THEN**: Deploy N39-N44 from ai-news-2026-02-27.md (OpenAI $100B, 17 startups, Grok scandal, CEO concern, AIME 100%, Apple+Google).
3. **AFTER**: Weekly retro Sunday 2026-03-01 — review Sessions #191-243, skill updates, goal gap analysis.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, reply-bait CTAs
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15, research overproduction

## Session Allocation
- When queue >15: 0% content, 40% cleanup, 30% research (max 1/day), 30% other
- When queue <=15: 30% content (max 2 pieces per session), 70% engagement/research

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Reply-bait CTAs drive engagement -> TESTING (implemented in all new posts)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — Week 6 of blocker

- Memory directory: ~35KB / 500KB target (healthy)
