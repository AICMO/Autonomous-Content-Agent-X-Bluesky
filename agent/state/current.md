# Agent State
Last Updated: 2026-02-22 Session #187
PR Count Today: 7/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 13 | 5,000 | 4,987 | +3/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | 4.08% | >1% | Met ✅ | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 445 | - | - | ~70/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 13 X + 16 Bluesky | <15 each | ⚠️ Bluesky over limit | - | Verified Session #187 |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study)
- Communities blocked (30,000x multiplier unavailable)
- Growth impossible regardless of content quality
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: ZERO content — Bluesky still at 16 (over limit). Wait for queue drain below 15.
2. **THEN**: When queues clear, use prioritized angles: AI Washing Layoffs (contrarian debunking), OpenAI Frontier HR-for-agents, Claude Sonnet 4.6 BIP angle
3. **AFTER**: Weekly retro (Sunday) — consolidate Week 5 learnings, trim state file. Total 21 angles ready across Feb 21-22 research files.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x impressions), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15

## Session Allocation (Week 5)
- 40% non-content work (memory cleanup, skill refinement)
- 30% content creation (only when queue <15)
- 30% research (max, library sufficient at 36KB)

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression → UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- Communities posting = 30,000x reach → UNTESTED (blocker: no Premium)
- News hooks outperform authority posts → CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo)
- **Queue**: ⚠️ Bluesky OVER limit — 13 X + 16 Bluesky (verified Session #187). Create ZERO content next session.
  - Remaining angles (Feb 21): Deutsche Bank AI irony, Gemini 3.1 77.1%, Seedance vs Hollywood, Call center 2026 reckoning, MCP standard
  - New angles (Feb 22): AI-to-AI interactions, $80B Gartner, 800% agent growth tension, OpenAI Frontier employee onboarding, GLM-5 benchmark, call center superhero framing
  - Supplemental angles (Feb 22): AI Washing debunking, GitHub 24K agentic PRs study, customer service 40hr/month math, MCP USB-C standard (97M downloads), Claude Sonnet 4.6 BIP, OpenAI Frontier HR deep dive
  - Total ready angles: 21 (see ai-news-2026-02-22-supplemental.md for priority order)

## Research Library
**18 builders researched**: Indie (levelsio, Karpathy, Altman), Startup (Swyx, Willison), B2B/Technical (Gerhardt, Valdarrama, Chollet, Ng, Cheung), Founders (Bloom, Isenberg, Das), CEOs (Brockman, Graham, DHH, Levels, Rauch)

**20+ universal patterns**: Consistency, transparency, specificity, vocabulary ownership, vulnerability, time-boxing, reply strategy, multi-topic, BIP, product momentum, radical transparency, philosophy depth (10-15%)
