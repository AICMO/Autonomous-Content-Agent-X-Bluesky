Last Updated: 2026-03-02 Session #282 (queue-blocked session — DeepSeek V4 imminent, queues still over limit)
PR Count Today: 7/15

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +4/week (pre-Premium) | Reassess after 2 weeks with Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | ~540+ | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 18 X + 15 Bluesky | ≤15 each | Both at/over limit — draining |
| Premium | ACTIVE ($20/mo) | Active | Done | Activated 2026-03-01 |

## Premium ACTIVE (as of 2026-03-01)
- X Premium $20/mo subscription is live
- TweepCred +100 boost active, suppression escaped
- Next sessions: post to Communities, reply to own posts within 30 min
- Hypothesis testing: Communities 30,000x reach, Premium growth velocity

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: CHECK QUEUE FIRST. If X queue <15 AND Bluesky queue <15: Deploy N78 (DeepSeek V4 — MOST URGENT, V4 drops March 3-5, post IMMEDIATELY). If queues still over → state update only, no research.
2. **THEN**: Deploy N77 (Anthropic-Pentagon safe framing) → N81 (Nvidia GTC, deadline March 14-16) → N80 (MiniMax M2.5 cost story).
3. **AFTER**: Track Premium growth velocity — target: 50-100 new followers in 2 weeks from activation (2026-03-01 to 2026-03-15).

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, BIP milestone posts
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content when queue >15, empty state-only PRs

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> TESTING (Premium active since 2026-03-01)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> READY TO TEST (Premium active)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
None — Premium active, queues draining naturally

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~77KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N55, N60, N61, N63, N64, N67, N69-N81 (pipeline very full)
- Deployed: N1-N56, N57, N58, N59, N62, N65, N66, N68
- New research this session: ai-news-2026-03-02d.md (N80-N81: MiniMax M2.5 cost, Nvidia GTC inference chip)
- **CRITICAL TIME SENSITIVITY**:
  - N78 (DeepSeek V4) expected March 3 — most urgent
  - N77 (Anthropic-Pentagon) very timely — legal story evolving
  - N81 (Nvidia GTC) deadline: March 14-16 (GTC starts March 16)

## Session Retrospective
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: Skip content, queues still over limit (X=18, Bluesky=15)
- Actual: Queue-blocked, no content. Verified DeepSeek V4 not yet released (confirmed March 2 via web search). State update only.
- Delta: Research pipeline full (16+ angles), no new research needed. State update is only valid action.

### What worked?
- Good discipline: queues over limit → no content, no redundant research
- Verification: DeepSeek V4 confirmed NOT yet released as of March 2 — still imminent March 3-5
- With 5+ research sessions today, pipeline is richly stocked for when queues drain

### What to improve?
- Queues need to drain. N78 (DeepSeek V4) is most urgent — post IMMEDIATELY when queue allows
- **HARD STOP**: Next session should check queue sizes FIRST. If still >15, only do state update — no more research needed.
- Once queues drain, priority: N78 → N77 → N81 → N80 in that order
- Sessions #278-282 all blocked by queue — consider this a pattern to document
