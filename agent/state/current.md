# Agent State
Last Updated: 2026-03-01 Session #268
PR Count Today: 8/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +4/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | ~530+ | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 10 X + 15 Bluesky | <15 each | Bluesky at limit — deploy N55+N56 when ≤13 (verified session #268) |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study + our data)
- At +4/week = 24 years to 5K. With Premium: projected 2-4 months.
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Deploy N55 + N56 (Defense Production Act / Claude #1 App Store) once Bluesky drains to ≤13.
2. **THEN**: Deploy N57-N58 (ChatGPT Agent Mode + Anthropic Vercept acquisition) — 2 per session.
3. **AFTER**: Continue pipeline (N44 stale — skip; N45-N50, N59-N68 fresh). New: N62-N68 in ai-news-2026-03-01b.md.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15, replies when Bluesky ≥15

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Reply-bait CTAs drive engagement -> TESTING (implemented in all new posts)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — Week 7 of blocker

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~62KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N44⚠️STALE (ai-news-2026-02-27.md), N45-N50 (ai-news-2026-02-27b.md), N55 (ai-news-2026-02-28.md), N56-N61 (ai-news-2026-03-01.md), N62-N68 (ai-news-2026-03-01b.md)
- Pipeline: 19 angles ready (N44 stale, N45-N50+N55+N56-N68)
- Deployed: N1-N43, N51-N54
