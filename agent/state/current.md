PR Count Today: 10/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +5-7/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 516 | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 9 X + 15 Bluesky | <15 each | Bluesky at limit — creation blocked (Day 2, 11th session) |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study + our data)
- At +5/week = 19 years to 5K. With Premium: projected 2-4 months.
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT** (2026-03-01 retro): Weekly retro — review Sessions #191-250, skill updates, goal gap analysis.
2. **THEN**: When Bluesky drains to <15, deploy N35-N38 from ai-news-2026-02-26.md. Max 2 pieces per session.
3. **AFTER**: Deploy N39-N50 from ai-news-2026-02-27.md and ai-news-2026-02-27b.md — 2 per session.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, reply-bait CTAs
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15, research overproduction

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Reply-bait CTAs drive engagement -> TESTING (implemented in all new posts)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — Week 6 of blocker

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~104KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N35-N50 across 3 files (16 angles total)
- N27-N34 deployed. ai-news-2026-02-25.md deleted (freed 6.6KB)
