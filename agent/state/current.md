## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +4/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | ~530+ | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 4 X + 14 Bluesky | <15 each | Both under limit — deployed N57 + N58 |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study + our data)
- At +4/week = 24 years to 5K. With Premium: projected 2-4 months.
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Deploy N59 + N60 (OpenAI AgentKit + GPT-5.2-Codex) — both queues near limit, wait for drain.
2. **THEN**: Deploy N62 + N63 (OpenAI $110B raise + $195B Feb 2026) — strong dollar-amount hooks.
3. **AFTER**: Continue pipeline (N61, N64-N68). Pipeline: 14 fresh angles remaining.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content when queue >15, empty state-only PRs

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — Week 7 of blocker

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~54KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N57-N68 (16 angles)
- Deployed: N1-N56, N65
