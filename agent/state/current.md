## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 6 | 5,000 | 4,994 | 0.75/day | ~18 years at current pace — requires fundamental strategy change |
| Engagement Rate | Unknown | >1% | Unknown | No metrics access | TBD |
| Tweets Posted | ~81 posted + 49 pending | - | - | ~10/day average | - |
| Replies Posted | 31 total posted, ~18 queued | 1/session | Volume achieved, results not | - |

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Content freeze session — queue is at 49 (WAY above 15 cap). Focus on profile optimization research.
2. **THEN**: Profile optimization — bio, pinned tweet, banner. One-time task overdue since Week 2.
3. **AFTER**: Resume content at low volume — max 1 piece per session once queue < 15.

## Completed This Session
- ✅ Verified queue status: 49 pending (above 15 cap) → content freeze enforced
- ✅ Researched X profile optimization best practices (2026)
- ✅ Researched X Premium algorithm impact (10x reach boost)
- ✅ Researched X communities for growth strategy
- ✅ Created comprehensive profile optimization research doc
- ✅ Created X communities research doc
- ✅ Drafted optimized bio options (159 chars)
- ✅ Created actionable profile action plan for owner

## Metrics Delta
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Pending queue | 53 | 49 | -4 | Still above cap |
| PR count | 10/10 | 0/10 | Reset | New day |

## Active Framework
Current: PDCA + Quality-First (replacing Engagement-First volume approach)
Reason: Volume of both content and replies proved ineffective. 215 tweets + 31 replies = 6 followers. Quality and timeliness matter more than volume.

## Active Hypotheses
| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Content-only grows followers | **Rejected** | 6 followers after 215 tweets |
| Reply engagement > original content for growth | **Inconclusive** | 31 replies posted, +1 follower. May need more time or better execution. |
| X Premium is prerequisite for meaningful growth | **Needs Owner Action** | Buffer study: non-Premium = 0% median engagement. This is the most likely explanation for near-zero growth. |
| Bulk replies to mega-accounts drive followers | **Likely Rejected** | 31 replies to accounts with 200K-4.2M followers = +1 follower |
| Stale replies (>24h) have negligible value | **Likely Confirmed** | Queue delays meant most replies posted hours/days after original. Zero measurable impact. |
| Quality > quantity for small accounts | **Testing** | Week 4 will test reduced volume + higher quality |
| Content diversification improves appeal | **Testing** | Week 4 will test broader content angles beyond agent |

## Session Retrospective
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: Content freeze session — focus on profile optimization research
- Actual: Enforced content freeze (0 content created), completed profile optimization research + bio drafts + communities research + action plan
- Delta: ✅ Plan executed as intended. Delivered comprehensive research and actionable recommendations for owner.

### What worked?
- Content freeze discipline: Verified queue at 49, created ZERO new content (following Week 3 rules)
- Research depth: 3x web searches per topic (profile, Premium, communities)
- Actionable outputs: Created owner-ready action plan with costs, timelines, success metrics
- Evidence-based: All recommendations backed by 2026 data sources

### What to improve?
- Next session: Actually check current X profile (bio, banner, pinned tweet) for baseline
- Missing: Screenshot/save current profile state before recommending changes
- Consider: Manual profile visit → follower conversion tracking (since no API metrics)

## Blockers
### P0 — X Premium ($8/month)
- Non-Premium accounts have 0% median engagement since March 2026
- Premium gives 10x more reach, priority reply ranking, blue checkmark
- **This is likely the primary reason for near-zero growth**
- **Action needed from repo owner**: Subscribe to X Premium

### P1 — Queue at 49 pending
- 49 items pending (down from 53)
- At workflow drain rate of ~3-5 per successful run, will take many runs to clear
- **Must drain to <15 before creating any new content**

### P2 — Metrics Access
- X API Free tier has no read access
- Cannot validate any strategy with data
- Options: manual metrics from human, or Basic tier ($100/month)
