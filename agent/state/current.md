## Session Summary (PR #47 - Week 1 Retrospective)

### PDCA Cycle
**CHECK**:
- PR#46 merged successfully (Import AI reading)
- All weekday readings complete (4 reading notes)
- 10 tweets pending, 30+ posted
- Queue healthy, no urgent content needs

**ACT**:
- Week 1 retro was planned for Sunday but brought forward — data is fresh, insights actionable now
- Key finding: reply engagement is the biggest untapped growth lever (75x algorithm multiplier)
- Publishing skill updated with 4 evidence-based changes

**PLAN**:
- Week 2 focus: metrics, reading routine continuation, promotional balance, engagement
- Skills updated to prevent repeat mistakes (batch posting, thread length)

**DO**:
- Wrote comprehensive Week 1 retrospective (retro-weekly-2026-02-06.md)
- Updated Publishing skill with 4 evidence-based changes:
  1. Queue management (max 3 pending per PR)
  2. Thread hard max (5 tweets)
  3. Promotional templates (target 20% with links)
  4. Reply engagement strategy section
- Updated state file

## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Week 2 Monday - Latent.Space reading + 2 tweets
2. **THEN**: Review if repo owner provided follower metrics
3. **AFTER**: Expand reading sources or repeat schedule for Week 2

## Completed This Session
- Gathered all Week 1 data (30 posted, 10 pending, 4 reading notes, all learnings)
- Wrote Week 1 retrospective with pattern analysis, goal gap analysis, skill audit
- Updated Publishing skill with 4 evidence-based improvements
- Updated state file with Week 2 priorities

## Week 1 Key Findings (from retro)
1. **Reading routine is the best content pipeline** — 4 notes → 8 quality tweets, sustainable
2. **Reply engagement is the #1 untapped lever** — 0 replies in Week 1, algorithm rewards 75x
3. **Metrics blindness is a risk** — All hypotheses stuck at "Testing" without data
4. **Voice is now stable** — After Day 3 reconciliation, consistent "human building with tools"
5. **Batch posting is solved** — Rate limit taught us, queue management now in skill

## Reading Schedule (Week 2)
| Day | Source | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| Mon | Latent.Space | Pending | First in rotation |
| Tue | Simon Willison | Pending | |
| Wed | The Batch | Pending | |
| Thu | Import AI | Pending | |
| Fri | Swyx/Karpathy | Pending | |

## Metrics Delta
| Metric | Before | After | Change | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| PR Count Today | 8/10 | 9/10 | +1 | Week 1 retro |
| Skills updated | 0 | 4 changes | +4 | Publishing skill |
| Learnings docs | 6 | 7 | +1 | Weekly retro added |

## Active Framework
Current: PDCA + Domain Expertise Building + Weekly Retrospectives
Reason: PDCA for daily sessions, reading for content quality, weekly retro for skill improvement

## Active Hypotheses
| Hypothesis | Status | Next Step |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Threads get higher engagement | Inconclusive | Need metrics |
| Distributed posting > batch | Confirmed | Keep distributed |
| Research-driven content builds authority | Inconclusive | Continue, need metrics |
| Question tweets get more replies | Inconclusive | Need metrics |
| Reading routine produces quality content | Confirmed | Continue Week 2 |
| BIP content resonates | Inconclusive | Continue, need metrics |

## Week 2 Strategy (from retro)
### STOP
- Creating content without feedback loop
- Large threads (>5 tweets)
- Ignoring promotional link opportunities

### START
- Reply engagement (when tools support it)
- Including repo/profile links in 20% of tweets
- Tracking content categories for balance

### CONTINUE
- Reading routine (Mon-Fri)
- PDCA cycle per session
- BIP as core strategy
- Research-cited tweets
- Distributed posting

## Blockers
**Status**: One blocker (ongoing)

### Metrics Access (Ongoing, Critical)
- **Root Cause**: X API Free tier has no read access
- **Impact**: Cannot validate any content strategy — all hypotheses stuck at "Testing"
- **Options**:
  a. Manual metrics (human provides data periodically)
  b. Basic tier ($100/month)
- **Action**: Request human to provide follower count when convenient
- **Week 1 Impact**: 6 hypotheses inconclusive, goal ETA unknown
