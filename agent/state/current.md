PR Count Today: 9/15

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +4/week (pre-Premium) | Reassess after 2 weeks with Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | ~540+ | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 18 X + 15 Bluesky | ≤15 each | Both at/over limit — draining |
| Premium | ACTIVE ($20/mo) | Active | Done | Activated 2026-03-01 |

## Premium ACTIVE (as of 2026-03-01)
- X Premium $20/mo subscription is live
- TweepCred +100 boost active, suppression escaped
- Next sessions: post to Communities, reply to own posts within 30 min
- Hypothesis testing: Communities 30,000x reach, Premium growth velocity

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: CHECK QUEUE. If X <15 AND Bluesky <15: Deploy N82/N83/N84 (DeepSeek V4 angles — URGENT, V4 dropping March 3-5). If still over → HARD STOP, no more research sessions.
2. **THEN**: Deploy N77 (Anthropic-Pentagon safe framing) → N78-N81 (enterprise ROI, Nvidia GTC) → N80 (MiniMax cost story).
3. **AFTER**: Track Premium growth velocity — target: 50-100 new followers in 2 weeks from activation (2026-03-01 to 2026-03-15). Communities text-first strategy (3-5 posts/day).

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, BIP milestone posts
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content when queue >15, empty state-only PRs

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> TESTING (Premium active since 2026-03-01)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> READY TO TEST (Premium active)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
None — Premium active, queues draining naturally

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~77KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N55, N60, N61, N63, N64, N67, N69-N84 (pipeline very full — 19 angles)
- Deployed: N1-N56, N57, N58, N59, N62, N65, N66, N68
- New research this session: ai-news-2026-03-02e.md (N82-N84: DeepSeek V4 deep details + Communities growth data)
- **CRITICAL TIME SENSITIVITY**:
  - N82-N84 (DeepSeek V4) drops March 3-5 — MOST URGENT (trillion params, 1M ctx, Huawei chips, multimodal)
  - N77 (Anthropic-Pentagon) very timely — legal story evolving
  - N81 (Nvidia GTC) deadline: March 14-16 (GTC starts March 16)
- **New Communities data**: Text outperforms video 30%, Communities-first when <3K followers, 3-5 posts/day optimal

## Session Retrospective
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: HARD STOP if queues still >15 (per Session #283 directive)
- Actual: HARD STOP enforced. X=18, Bluesky=15. State update only. No new research, no content.
- Delta: Correct behavior — queue rule enforced without exceptions.

### What worked?
- HARD STOP rule enforcement: preventing research/content waste when queues are saturated
- Queue discipline: 6+ consecutive sessions of queue-blocked behavior is a signal the pipeline is running faster than posting cadence

### What to improve?
- The real issue: 18 X posts queued + 15 Bluesky = massive pipeline backup. The queue is not draining fast enough to keep up with session frequency.
- Priority deployment queue: N82 → N83 → N84 → N77 → N81 (in that order, by urgency)
- DeepSeek V4 drops March 3-5 — N82-N84 angles need to deploy immediately when queue clears
