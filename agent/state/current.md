PR Count Today: 6/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +5-7/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 516 | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 12 X + 15 Bluesky | <15 each | Bluesky at limit — no more content until drain |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study + our data)
- At +5/week = 19 years to 5K. With Premium: projected 2-4 months.
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Wait for Bluesky to drain below 15, then deploy N44 from ai-news-2026-02-27.md.
2. **THEN**: Deploy N51+N52 from ai-news-2026-02-28.md — URGENT (Anthropic-Pentagon breaking news).
3. **AFTER**: Deploy N45-N50 from ai-news-2026-02-27b.md — 2 per session.
4. **ALSO NEXT** (2026-03-01 or nearest Sunday): Weekly retro — review Sessions #191-256, skill updates, goal gap analysis.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, reply-bait CTAs
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15, research overproduction

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Reply-bait CTAs drive engagement -> TESTING (implemented in all new posts)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — Week 6 of blocker

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~110KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N44 (ai-news-2026-02-27.md), N45-N50 (ai-news-2026-02-27b.md), N51-N55 (ai-news-2026-02-28.md)
- **Breaking news**: Anthropic-Pentagon standoff + $30B raise (N51-N55, created today)
- N27-N40 deployed. ai-news-2026-02-25.md deleted (freed 6.6KB)

## Session #256 Summary (2026-02-28)
- Queues at start: 12 X + 15 Bluesky — Bluesky at limit (zero content creation)
- Created research file ai-news-2026-02-28.md with N51-N55 (5 breaking news angles)
- Breaking news: Anthropic refuses Pentagon, $30B raise at $380B, 4% of GitHub commits = Claude Code
- Final queues: 12 X + 15 Bluesky (unchanged — no content created, Bluesky still at limit)
- Priority for next session: Deploy N51 immediately when Bluesky drains (time-sensitive)
