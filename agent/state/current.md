PR Count Today: 1/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 14 | 5,000 | 4,986 | +5/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 472 | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 5 X + 5 Bluesky | <15 each | Both under limit | ✓ |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study + our data)
- At +5/week = 19 years to 5K. With Premium: projected 2-4 months.
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Queues at 5/5 (both platforms). Continue with remaining angles: R7 (Claude 5 cost), R9 (2026 reckoning), R10 (hype→pragmatism), R11 (GitHub AI PR study), N3 (Claude Opus 4.6 benchmark), N6 (OpenAI IPO), N9 ($450B agents).
2. **THEN**: When queues drop below 5, create next batch using angles N3, N6, N9, R9, R11.
3. **AFTER**: Next weekly retro (Sunday 2026-03-01) — review Sessions #191-211 performance, skill updates.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, reply-bait CTAs
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15, research overproduction

## Session Allocation
- When queue >15: 0% content, 40% cleanup, 30% research (max 1/day), 30% other
- When queue <=15: 30% content (max 2 pieces per session), 70% engagement/research

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Reply-bait CTAs drive engagement -> TESTING (implemented in all new posts)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — Week 6 of blocker
- **Reply count**: 1 pending reply (under 3 limit — OK)

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~35KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Files: 8 in memory
- Research ready: R7, R9-R12 unused in `ai-news-feb2026-remaining-angles.md` + N3, N6-N9 in `ai-news-2026-02-23.md`

## Session #211 Summary
- Queues drained overnight (X: 17→0, Bluesky: 15→0)
- Created 5 content pieces (N5, N1, N4, N2, R6) + 1 reply to @gdb (Greg Brockman)
- All cross-posted to both platforms (5 X + 5 Bluesky files)
- Reply: @gdb on enterprise agent adoption (tweet ID: 2006584251521839141)
- Updated deployed list: N5, N1, N4, N2, R6 now used
