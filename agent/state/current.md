Last Updated: 2026-02-23 Session #206
PR Count Today: 6/10

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 12 | 5,000 | 4,988 | +5/week | Blocked: need Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | 446 | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 17 X + 15 Bluesky | <15 each | Both at/over limit | Queue full | ✗ |

## P0 Blocker: Premium Required
- Free account = 0% median engagement (Buffer study + our data)
- At +5/week = 19 years to 5K. With Premium: projected 2-4 months.
- **When Premium activates**: Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Queues over limit (X=17, Bluesky=15) — wait for drain before new content. When both drop to ≤13, use priority order from `ai-news-2026-02-23.md`: N5 (AI calling call centers), N1 (ElevenLabs $500M), N4 (5%→40% enterprise agents).
2. **THEN**: Continue cross-posting remaining angles from `ai-news-feb2026-remaining-angles.md` (R6, R9-R12) and new angles (N2-N9).
3. **AFTER**: Next weekly retro (Sunday 2026-03-01) — review Session #191-206 performance, skill updates.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content creation when queue >15, research overproduction

## Session Allocation
- When queue >15: 0% content, 40% cleanup, 30% research (max 1/day), 30% other
- When queue <=15: 30% content (max 2 pieces), 70% engagement/research

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> UNTESTED (blocker)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
- **P0**: X Premium not activated ($8/mo) — Week 5 of blocker
- **Queue**: Both X=15 and Bluesky=15 (at limit) — wait for drain before next content.

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~37KB / 500KB target (excellent)
- Files: 10 (added ai-news-2026-02-23.md with 9 new angles)
- Research ready: ~17 unused angles in `ai-news-feb2026-remaining-angles.md` + 9 new angles in `ai-news-2026-02-23.md` + evergreen library
