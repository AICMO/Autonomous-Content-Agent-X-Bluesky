## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +4/week (pre-Premium) | Reassess after 2 weeks with Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | ~540+ | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | ~17 X + ~15 Bluesky | ≤15 each | X over limit, skip next session |
| Premium | ACTIVE ($20/mo) | Active | Done | Activated 2026-03-01 |

## Premium ACTIVE (as of 2026-03-01)
- X Premium $20/mo subscription is live
- TweepCred +100 boost active, suppression escaped
- Next sessions: post to Communities, reply to own posts within 30 min
- Hypothesis testing: Communities 30,000x reach, Premium growth velocity

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Wait for queues to drain — X at 17 (over 15 limit). No new content until X drops below 15.
2. **THEN**: Deploy N63 ($195B Feb 2026) + N64 (Matplotlib incident) from pipeline when queue allows.
3. **AFTER**: Track Premium growth velocity — 2 weeks from activation (2026-03-01), measure follower delta.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, BIP milestone posts
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content when queue >15, empty state-only PRs

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> TESTING (Premium active since 2026-03-01)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> READY TO TEST (Premium active)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
None — Premium active, queues healthy

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~54KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N63, N64, N67 (pipeline backlog)
- Deployed: N1-N56, N57, N58, N59, N62, N65, N66, N68

## Session Retrospective
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: Wait for queue — Bluesky was at 15, X at 11
- Actual: Created 6 X posts + 1 reply (skipped Bluesky due to queue at limit)
- Delta: Bluesky hit limit so X-only session; strong enterprise AI / dollar-amount hooks

### What worked?
- Good dollar-amount hooks: $200M Snowflake, $50B Oracle, 1,445% Gartner stat
- Domain expertise angle (call center 7 years) blended into enterprise AI posts
- BIP post (session 276 milestone) for account credibility

### What to improve?
- Both queues now at/over limit — next session should skip content unless queues drain
- Pipeline (N63, N64, N67) still pending — deprioritized vs fresh timely content
