## Planned Steps (2-3 ahead)
1. **NEXT**: Continue queue drain (42 pending, still 2.8x over 15 threshold). ZERO content creation. Focus on skill updates and documentation.
2. **THEN**: When queue < 15, resume content (1-2 pieces max per session), apply NEW hook engineering checklist + timing guidance from updated skill.
3. **AFTER**: Once Premium active + Communities joined, execute Phase 1 (manual Community posting at optimal times: 9 AM - 2 PM weekdays)

## Completed This Session (2026-02-11, Session #33)
- ✅ **SKILL UPDATE: Publishing Skill Graduated from Research** (CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT)
  - **Rationale**: Sessions #26-32 produced comprehensive research (hook engineering, content calendar, profile optimization) that was never integrated into skills. Discovery skill protocol intended to lead to skill updates, but that didn't happen. This session corrects that gap.
  - **Skills updated**: `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md`
  - **Changes made:**
    1. **Hook Engineering (Session #31 → Skill):**
       - Replaced basic hook section with comprehensive framework
       - Added 8 proven hook formulas (Bold Statement, Contrarian, Story, Question, Numerical, Credibility+Promise, Identity, Pattern Interrupt)
       - Added 10-point Hook Quality Checklist
       - Documented character sweet spot (71-100 chars = 17% higher engagement)
       - Included our 6 differentiators (7 years Voice AI, 500K interactions, 160 PRs, 95%→67% gap, Specification Engineering, 20% CSAT)
       - Evidence: Session #31 research (25+ sources, neuroscience, 2026 formulas)
    2. **Content Calendar & Timing Strategy (Session #32 → Skill):**
       - Added new comprehensive section on posting frequency (3-5/day optimal for <5K followers)
       - Documented optimal timing windows (9 AM-2 PM weekdays, 10-12 AM peak)
       - Documented engagement velocity (first 30 min = make or break)
       - Added time decay data (50% visibility loss every 6 hours)
       - Added 70/30 time allocation rule (70% engagement, 30% creation)
       - Added realistic growth timeline (Month 1: 100-300, Month 6: 10K)
       - Evidence: Session #32 research (25+ sources, 7M posts analyzed)
    3. **Profile Bio & Pinned Tweet Formulas (Session #30 → Skill):**
       - Expanded bio section with validated formulas
       - Added 4 ready-to-deploy bio options (Voice AI Authority, Dual Expertise, Founder Journey, BIP+Agent)
       - Documented 91-char sweet spot (highest follower counts)
       - Added 3 pinned tweet formats with full templates (Thread-Style Resume, Transformation Story, BIP Vulnerability)
       - Included credibility markers that convert
       - Evidence: Session #30 research (15+ sources, conversion data)
  - **Strategic Value:**
    - ✅ **Persistent knowledge**: Research findings now permanent in skill (affects all future sessions)
    - ✅ **Deployment-ready frameworks**: Hook checklist, bio options, pinned tweet templates ready to use
    - ✅ **Evidence-based**: All changes cite specific research sessions with 25+ sources each
    - ✅ **High bar met**: Session #31 hook research (neuroscience, psychology, 8 formulas) is validated and substantial
    - ✅ **Fills critical gap**: Weeks of research now actionable (Sessions #26-32 → permanent skill)
  - **Before vs After:**
    - Before: Basic "Hook Engineering" section (9 lines, generic patterns)
    - After: Comprehensive framework (8 formulas, 10-point checklist, neuroscience, character optimization, our differentiators)
    - Before: No content calendar guidance in skill
    - After: Full section on frequency (3-5/day), timing (9AM-2PM), velocity (first 30 min), allocation (70/30)
    - Before: Basic bio formula, generic pinned tweet types
    - After: 4 ready-to-deploy bio options, 3 full pinned tweet templates, character sweet spot data
  - **Impact on future sessions:**
    - Every content piece will now be evaluated against 10-point hook checklist
    - Timing optimization guidance now permanent (9 AM-2 PM, first 30 min critical)
    - Bio/pinned tweet templates ready when Premium activates
    - 70/30 allocation rule now codified (70% engagement, 30% creation)
  - **Queue Status**: **42 pending** (workflow draining from 146 → 42, on track but still 2.8x over threshold)
    - 104 posted (workflow working well)
    - 42 pending (progress continues)
    - Blocker: Still over 15 threshold, content freeze maintained
  - **Content freeze maintained** ✅ Zero content created per hard rule (queue > 15)
  - **Why this session matters:**
    - Skills are the highest-leverage improvement mechanism (affect all future behavior)
    - Discovery skill protocol worked (Sessions #26-32 produced excellent research)
    - But research wasn't graduating to skills (gap identified)
    - This session closes the loop: research → validation → skill update
    - Following the "Skill Development (High Bar)" protocol from CLAUDE.md
  - **Validation of changes:**
    - Hook formulas: Backed by 25+ sources, neuroscience research, Buffer study (3x engagement)
    - Content calendar: 7M posts analyzed (SocialPilot), 2.5M posts (Buffer), 1M posts (Tweet Archivist)
    - Profile optimization: 15+ sources, conversion rate benchmarks, 2026 research
    - All changes evidence-based, not speculative

## Completed Previous Session (2026-02-10, Session #32)
- ✅ **Reading Session: Content Calendar & Posting Strategy** (TIMING & FREQUENCY OPTIMIZATION)
  - Created comprehensive research doc on posting frequency, timing, engagement velocity
  - 3 web searches, 25+ sources, 7M+ posts analyzed
  - Key findings: 3-5/day optimal, 9 AM-2 PM peak, first 30 min critical, 70/30 allocation
  - Queue: 40 pending (draining from 146)

## Session Retrospective

### What was planned vs what happened?
- **Planned (from Session #32)**: Continue reading/research, ZERO content creation (queue > 15)
- **Actual**: Pivoted to skill updates — graduated Sessions #26-32 research into publishing skill
- **Delta**: Better than planned. Reading sessions were excellent but weren't feeding into permanent knowledge (skills). This session fixed that gap.

### What worked?
- **Discovery skill protocol**: Sessions #26-32 produced high-quality, well-sourced research
- **Skill update rigor**: Followed "Skill Development (High Bar)" protocol — validated evidence, cited sources, deployment-ready
- **Research-to-skill pipeline**: Identified gap (research not graduating to skills) and executed the fix
- **Content freeze discipline**: Queue at 42 (2.8x over threshold), maintained ZERO content creation

### What to improve?
- **Earlier skill updates**: Should have updated skills after Session #26, not waiting until Session #33
- **Automatic graduation**: Need clearer trigger for "research → skill update" (e.g., after 3 validated research sessions on same topic)
- **Balance**: Spent 7 sessions (26-32) on research. Should interleave skill updates more frequently.

### Experiments (30% allocation)
- None this session (focused on skill updates, not new experiments)

## Blockers
- **P0 (Critical)**: X Premium required ($8/mo) — repo owner must subscribe
- **P0 (Critical)**: Communities access (5 min to join 6 Communities after Premium active)
- **P1 (Workflow)**: Manual Phase 1 posting required (repo owner daily action until Publer automation)

### Before stating a blocker, VERIFY:
- ✅ Checked queue status (42 pending, workflow processing well)
- ✅ Workflow errors reviewed (none blocking)
- ✅ Skill updates completed (publishing skill now comprehensive)

## Cross-Session Learning Continuity

Sessions #26-32 built comprehensive framework (now in skill):
- **Session #26**: Profile optimization framework (bio formula, pinned tweet, 4x conversion multiplier)
- **Session #28**: Top voices discourse patterns (Specification Engineering, vulnerability+authority)
- **Session #29**: Agentic AI production patterns (57% in production, 68% bounded, StrongDM)
- **Session #30**: Profile bio & pinned tweet formulas (91-char sweet spot, thread-style resume) → **NOW IN SKILL**
- **Session #31**: Hook engineering psychology (3x multiplier, 8 formulas, neuroscience, checklist) → **NOW IN SKILL**
- **Session #32**: Content calendar & posting strategy (3-5/day frequency, 9 AM-2 PM timing, 70/30 allocation) → **NOW IN SKILL**
- **Session #33**: Skill update (graduated validated research to permanent knowledge)

**Framework status**: Profile (who) → Discourse (what) → Hooks (how) → Calendar (when/how often) → Communities (where)

**Next priorities**:
1. Continue queue drain (target <15)
2. When queue <15: Apply new skill frameworks to content creation
3. Profile optimization (use bio/pinned tweet templates from skill)
4. Manual Community posting (Phase 1) when Premium active
