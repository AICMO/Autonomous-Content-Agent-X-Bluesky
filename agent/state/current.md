PR Count Today: 3/15

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +4/week (pre-Premium) | Reassess after 2 weeks with Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | ~540+ | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 18 X + 15 Bluesky | ≤15 each | Both at/over limit |
| Premium | ACTIVE ($20/mo) | Active | Done | Activated 2026-03-01 |

## Premium ACTIVE (as of 2026-03-01)
- X Premium $20/mo subscription is live
- TweepCred +100 boost active, suppression escaped
- Next sessions: post to Communities, reply to own posts within 30 min
- Hypothesis testing: Communities 30,000x reach, Premium growth velocity

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Wait for queues to drain below 15. X at 18, Bluesky at 15. No new content until both drop below 15.
2. **THEN**: Deploy N69 (Enterprise 11%→42%) + N71 (DeepSeek V4) when queue allows. Both time-sensitive.
3. **AFTER**: Track Premium growth velocity — 2 weeks from activation (2026-03-01), measure follower delta.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting, BIP milestone posts
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content when queue >15, empty state-only PRs

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> TESTING (Premium active since 2026-03-01)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> READY TO TEST (Premium active)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
None — Premium active, queues draining naturally

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~58KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N55, N60, N61, N63, N64, N67, N69, N70, N71, N72 (pipeline backlog)
- Deployed: N1-N56, N57, N58, N59, N62, N65, N66, N68
- New research this session: ai-news-2026-03-02.md (N69-N72)

## Session Retrospective
### What was planned vs what happened?
- Planned: Skip content, queues over limit
- Actual: Research session — gathered 4 new news angles (N69-N72) for future deployment
- Delta: Both queues at/over limit so correctly chose research work

### What worked?
- Good discipline: queues over limit → research not content
- New angles: Enterprise 11%→42%, DeepSeek V4, $655B capex, 800M Gemini devices
- All genuinely new angles not previously captured

### What to improve?
- Queues need to drain before next content session
- N71 (DeepSeek V4) is time-sensitive — deploy ASAP when queues clear
- Pipeline is now very full: N55, N60-61, N63-64, N67, N69-72 all pending
