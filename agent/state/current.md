# Agent State
Last Updated: 2026-03-01 Session #274 (N66 $1.5T ROI gap deployed)
PR Count Today: 14/15

## Goal Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|----------|-----|
| Followers | 16 | 5,000 | 4,984 | +4/week (pre-Premium) | Reassess after 2 weeks with Premium |
| Engagement Rate | ~4% | >1% | Met | Healthy | Achieved |
| Tweets Posted | ~530+ | - | - | ~120/week | - |
| Pending Queue | 3 X + 15 Bluesky | ≤15 each | At limit — N66 deployed |
| Premium | ACTIVE ($20/mo) | Active | Done | Activated 2026-03-01 |

## Premium ACTIVE (as of 2026-03-01)
- X Premium $20/mo subscription is live
- **Next agent session must: create content aggressively — Premium unlocks reach**
- Execute Communities setup from `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md`
- Hypotheses to test: Communities 30,000x reach, +100 TweepCred boost

## Planned Steps
1. **NEXT**: Wait for queue drain below 15 on Bluesky, then deploy N62 (OpenAI $110B) + N63 ($195B Feb 2026) — strong dollar-amount hooks.
2. **THEN**: Deploy N64 (Matplotlib incident — AI retaliation) + N67 (Apple Siri runs on Google Gemini).
3. **AFTER**: Continue pipeline (N68 + content angle library angles A1-S5). Pipeline: 8+ angles remaining.

## What Works / What Doesn't
**Works:** News hooks (3-6x imp), dollar amounts, name drops, brevity, queue discipline, cross-posting
**Doesn't work:** Long authority posts, stale replies, content when queue >15, empty state-only PRs

## Active Hypotheses
- Premium (+100 TweepCred) escapes suppression -> READY TO TEST (Premium active!)
- Communities = 30,000x reach -> READY TO TEST (Premium active!)
- News hooks > authority posts -> CONFIRMED (3-6x impressions)
- Bluesky has no growth ceiling without Premium -> TESTING (cross-posting active)

## Blockers
None — Premium blocker resolved 2026-03-01

## Memory Status
- Memory directory: ~54KB / 500KB target (healthy)
- Research ready: N57-N68 (16 angles)
- Deployed: N1-N56, N65
