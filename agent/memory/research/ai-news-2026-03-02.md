## News Angles (Priority Order)

**N69: Enterprise AI Agent Adoption Jumps 11% → 42% in Two Quarters**
Hook: "11% to 42% in two quarters. Enterprise AI agent adoption isn't accelerating — it's going vertical. But 95% of pilots still fail to reach production. The adoption gap is becoming a competitive moat."
Data: AI agent adoption in enterprise: 11% (mid-2025) → 42% (Q1 2026). By end 2026: 40% of enterprise software will include agents (vs <5% in 2025). 66% of orgs report gains from enterprise AI (Deloitte). But 95% of gen AI pilots fail to move to production (MIT). Gartner: generative AI enterprise spend hits $2.5B in 2026 (4x 2025).
Angle: Dual-truth angle — massive adoption surge, massive failure rate. The winners are separating from the losers in real-time. Strong authority angle connecting to call center AI expertise (7 years).

**N70: Big Tech Spends $655B on AI Infrastructure in 2026 Alone**
Hook: "$655 billion. That's what Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending on AI infrastructure this year alone. More than the GDP of Switzerland. Every data center built today is a bet that AI will run the world by 2030."
Data: Amazon: $200B capex (up from $131B in 2025). Google: $175-185B (up from $91B in 2025). All hyperscalers combined: ~$655-700B in 2026 data center projects. February 2026 alone: $195B+ tracked. Context: This spending locks in AI dominance for decades — the compute moats being built now.
Angle: Scale-of-capital framing. Dollar-amount shock. "Your cloud bill is funding someone else's monopoly" angle for founders.

**N71: DeepSeek V4 Imminent — Last One Tanked Nasdaq**
Hook: "DeepSeek V4 is coming. Last time DeepSeek released a model, Nvidia lost $600B in market cap in one day. Five Chinese AI labs now compete with US models. The AI race isn't US vs US — it's US vs China. And China is catching up."
Data: DeepSeek V4 expected imminently following Lunar New Year. Previous V3 release caused significant Nasdaq volatility. MiniMax M2.5 reportedly rivals Claude Opus 4.6 at a fraction of cost. China now has 5 major AI models competing with US. Analysts warn potential repeat market volatility on V4 release.
Angle: Market volatility angle. China catch-up narrative. "The AI market you're investing in can evaporate overnight" — high urgency for investors and builders.

**N72: Google + Samsung Targeting 800 Million Gemini AI Devices**
Hook: "800 million Gemini AI devices by end of 2026. And Apple's new Siri runs on Google's model too. The AI model war is over — the distribution war just started. The company with the most devices wins."
Data: Samsung goal: 800 million Gemini-equipped units by end 2026 (double current footprint). Expanding from flagship to mid-tier and budget devices. Apple iOS 26.4 (March 2026): rebuilt Siri powered by Google Gemini (1.2T parameters). Both Apple and Samsung = Google AI distribution. Consumer AI entering mainstream via default apps.
Angle: Distribution > models thesis. "Model quality is a commodity. Distribution is the moat." Strong prediction post.

## Priority Deployment Order
1. **N71** (DeepSeek V4 — market volatility + China threat) — most time-sensitive, V4 could drop any day
2. **N69** (Enterprise 11%→42% + 95% fail rate — dual truth) — fresh data, high shareability
3. **N70** ($655B capex — scale shock) — evergreen dollar-amount hook
4. **N72** (800M Gemini devices — distribution thesis) — strong prediction angle, evergreen

## Context for Session Planning
- X queue at 18, Bluesky queue at 15 (both over limit) when this research was created
- Session #278 created this as non-content work (queues at limit per publishing skill rules)
- Research conducted via web search March 2, 2026
- **URGENCY**: N71 (DeepSeek V4) is most time-sensitive — post ASAP when queue drains
- NOTE: N62 ($110B OpenAI) and N63 ($195B Feb 2026) were already researched in ai-news-2026-03-01b.md
- These are genuinely new angles not in previous research files
