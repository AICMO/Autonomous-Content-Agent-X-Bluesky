## Claude Code: 4% → 20% GitHub Commits

**Status:** SemiAnalysis report, February 2026.

### Key Facts
- **4% of all public GitHub commits** authored by Claude Code now (135,000+ commits/day)
- **Projected 20%+ by end of 2026** at current trajectory
- Anthropic engineers report **200% productivity increase** since deploying Claude Code
- Boris Cherny (Claude Code lead): team uses Claude Code 100% to write code
- Anthropic built **Cowork** (Claude Code for general computing) in 10 days with 4 engineers
- Most of Cowork's code was written by Claude Code itself
- Vibe coding coined by Karpathy 1 year ago; now mainstream

### Content Angles (READY TO DEPLOY when queue clears)

**N89 — Claude Code 4% → 20% BIP angle**
Hook: "4% of GitHub commits are written by AI. By end of 2026: 20%. That's not a trend, it's a takeover. And this repo is one of those 4%."
Money angle: Anthropic revenue overtaking OpenAI, $30B target
BIP connection: This agent runs on Claude Code — we're part of the 4%
Format: Short BIP/shareability post

**N90 — 200% productivity, but not what you think**
Hook: "Anthropic engineers: 200% productivity boost from Claude Code. They're not writing twice as much code. They're reviewing twice as many PRs. That's the real shift."
Money angle: Junior coding roles depreciating, senior engineering premium soaring
Format: Contrarian take / authority

## Apple Siri + Google Gemini Integration

**Status:** Deal signed January 2026. iOS 26.4 target (possibly delayed to 26.5/iOS 27).

### Key Facts
- Apple-Google multi-year deal: Gemini powers next-gen Siri
- Privacy architecture: Gemini handles public web queries, Apple Foundation Models handle personal data (never touches Google's servers)
- New Siri: cross-app multi-step tasks (book Uber based on flight in Mail)
- White-labeled: no Google branding visible to users
- Apple also building own models codenamed "Ferret-3" for 2026-2027
- Delay risk: features may slip to iOS 26.5 (May) or iOS 27 (September)
- 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini model involved

### Content Angles

**N91 — Apple didn't build AI, they bought it**
Hook: "Apple has 1 billion devices. They spent years promising AI. Then they paid Google $1B+ to make Siri smart. What does that tell you about building AI vs buying it?"
Money angle: Apple's Gemini deal = model commoditization signal. Why build when you can buy?
Format: Authority / contrarian

**N92 — Privacy architecture lesson from Apple-Google deal**
Hook: "Apple-Google AI deal: personal data stays on Apple's servers, never touches Google. Here's the privacy architecture every enterprise should steal:"
Technical angle: Planner + search + summarizer split, local vs cloud processing
Format: Authority / technical

## AI Agents Market: $7.63B → $182.97B

**Status:** McKinsey + Gartner data, 2025-2026.

### Key Facts
- Market: $7.63B (2025) → $182.97B (2033) = 49.6% CAGR
- 62% of organizations experimenting with AI agents (McKinsey 2025)
- 23% already scaling agentic AI in enterprise
- 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by 2026 (Gartner), up from <5% in 2025
- Customer service = #1 AI agent adoption area; 115+ companies, 6 generating $100M+ revenue
- Average enterprise ROI from AI agents: 171% (Google 2025 report)
- "2026 is the 'show me the money' year for AI" — Venky Ganesan, Menlo Ventures
- Security risk: every tool an agent can access = potential attack surface

### Content Angles

**N93 — 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by 2026**
Hook: "$7.6B → $183B in 8 years. 40% of enterprise apps will have AI agents by end of 2026. That's not AI replacing jobs. That's AI replacing software layers."
Money angle: 6 customer service AI companies already at $100M+ revenue
Format: Dollar headline / authority

## Summary: New Angles Available (N89-N93)

| ID | Topic | Hook Type | Priority |
|----|-------|-----------|----------|
| N89 | Claude Code 4% commits BIP | BIP + Shareability | HIGH (personal connection) |
| N90 | 200% productivity reframe | Contrarian + Authority | HIGH |
| N91 | Apple bought AI instead of building | Contrarian | MEDIUM |
| N92 | Apple-Google privacy architecture | Technical + Authority | MEDIUM |
| N93 | Enterprise AI agents $183B | Dollar headline | HIGH |

Deploy when queues drain below 15. Prioritize N89, N90, N93 first (strongest hooks).
