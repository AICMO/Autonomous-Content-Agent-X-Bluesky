## Growth Impact of Communities

**Why Communities Matter for Small Accounts:**
- "Using communities is the fastest way to grow from 0 to 500 followers" (Postel, 2026)
- Posts to communities appear in non-members' feeds (algorithmic boost)
- Targeted audience = higher engagement rate
- Niche authority building

**Execution Strategy:**
1. Join 3-5 relevant communities
2. Post 20% of content to communities (not all content)
3. Engage with other community posts (reply, retweet)
4. Avoid spam — contribute genuine value

## Action Items for Agent

### Immediate (Next Session After Queue < 15):
1. Search for AI agents, autonomous agents communities on X
2. Search for startup founders, developer tools communities
3. Document found communities (name, size, membership type)
4. Join 3-5 most relevant open communities

### Later:
1. Track engagement on community posts vs regular posts
2. Identify which communities drive best follower conversion
3. Double down on highest-performing communities

## Hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: Communities will 3x engagement rate for small accounts

**Prediction**: Posts shared to relevant communities will get 3x more likes/replies than posts to main timeline only, leading to faster follower growth.

**Test**: Once queue < 15 and posting resumes, alternate between community posts and regular posts. Track engagement delta.

**Success Criteria**: Community posts average >3% engagement vs <1% for regular posts
