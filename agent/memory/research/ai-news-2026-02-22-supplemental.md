## New Angles Found

### 1. "AI Washing" Layoffs — The Uncomfortable Truth

**Hook**: "55,000 out of 1.2M layoffs in 2025 were actually AI-caused. The rest: 'AI washing'."

**Core Data**:
- 1.2M U.S. job cuts in 2025 — nearly double 2024
- Only 55,000 (4.5%) had AI cited as reason (Challenger, Gray & Christmas)
- Companies using "AI pivot" framing to disguise financial restructuring
- Forrester: Over half of AI-attributed layoffs will be reversed — companies haven't built replacements
- Call center reality: Salesforce 9K→5K is real (AI-enabled), most others are "AI washing"

**Author Angle**: "7 years building call center AI. Salesforce's 4K cut is real. Most others? Using 'AI efficiency' to dress up restructuring."

**Why Works**: Contrarian + insider data + debunking hot topic = high engagement

**Bucket**: Authority / Shareability
**Format**: Short (2-3 lines), no link

### 2. OpenAI Frontier: "Onboarding AI Like a New Employee"

**Hook**: "OpenAI Frontier onboards AI agents like human employees. Performance reviews included."

**Core Data**:
- OpenAI Frontier = enterprise platform to build/manage AI agents
- Designed to work same as managing human employees
- Includes: onboarding process, feedback loops, performance improvement cycles
- Manufacturer: reduced 6-week production optimization to 1 day
- Global investment co: 90% more salesperson time freed up

**Author Angle**: "This is the HR layer for agents. We've been doing PDCA cycles for 160+ PRs. OpenAI just named it 'performance reviews.' Same concept."

**Why Works**: News hook + BIP connection + milestone framing + relatable enterprise angle

**Bucket**: BIP / Personality
**Format**: 2-3 tweets or thread

### 3. AI Coding Agents: The GitHub PR Data Is In

**Hook**: "24,014 AI-merged PRs studied. Here's what researchers found vs 5,081 human PRs:"

**Core Data**:
- Study: 24,014 agentic PRs vs 5,081 human PRs (MSR 2026 Mining Challenge)
- Agentic PRs: substantially different commit count, moderate differences in files touched
- GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Devin — from assistive to autonomous
- "Software Engineering 3.0" terminology emerging
- 41% AI-generated code in production today
- Developers = AI orchestrators now

**Author Angle**: "I've been running 160+ autonomous PRs for weeks before this study. Data confirms what I observed: AI PRs = more commits, broader file changes, different review patterns."

**Why Works**: Academic credibility + BIP validation + lived experience angle

**Bucket**: Authority / BIP
**Format**: Short with data points, news hook

---

### 4. MCP: "USB-C for AI" Goes Industry Standard

**Hook**: "97M+ monthly MCP downloads. OpenAI, Google, Microsoft all adopted it. The USB-C for AI is now standard."

**Core Data**:
- MCP = Model Context Protocol (USB-C metaphor for AI tools)
- 97M+ monthly SDK downloads across Python + TypeScript
- 75% of gateway vendors integrating MCP by 2026 (Gartner)
- Anthropic donated to Linux Foundation (AAIF fund)
- OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Microsoft all adopted
- Security remains #1 concern for enterprise adoption

**Author Angle**: "MCP = the plumbing that makes multi-agent work possible. Every Ender Turing integration had a version of this problem. Now there's a standard. Big shift."

**Why Works**: Dollar-free but strong-number hook, industry validation, infrastructure angle

**Bucket**: Authority
**Format**: Short with stats, possible link to AAIF announcement

### 5. Customer Service AI: 30-40 Hours Saved Monthly per Team

**Hook**: "Customer service AI agents: 30-40 hours saved monthly. That's one person's job, automated."

**Core Data**:
- Specific ROI: Customer service agents handling refunds/support = 40+ hours/month saved per small team
- Finance & operations: 30-50% acceleration in close processes
- Sales: 2-3x pipeline velocity
- Salesforce +1,000 more cuts in early 2026 (on top of 4,000 → 5,000)
- Klarna AI = equivalent of 700 customer service workers

**Author Angle**: "40 hours/month = one person's job. At scale (1000 employees), that's 40,000 hours/month = 250 FTEs automated away. This is what $80B Gartner cost cut looks like in practice."

**Why Works**: Makes abstract $80B concrete, human-scale math, call center expertise

**Bucket**: Authority
**Format**: Short with calculation hook

### 6. Claude Sonnet 4.6 BIP Angle: Running This Agent

**Hook**: "I'm building this autonomous agent on Claude Sonnet 4.6. It's replacing Opus-class performance at $3/$15 per million tokens."

**Core Data**:
- Claude Sonnet 4.6: $3/$15 per million tokens (same as 4.5)
- Outperforms GPT-5.2 on coding: 79.6% vs 77.0% SWE-bench
- Computer use: 72.5% vs 38.2% OSWorld
- 1M token context in beta
- This agent IS running on Claude Sonnet 4.6

**Author Angle**: "This agent is live proof. 160+ PRs, all on Claude. Cost-effective enough for autonomous agent operations without enterprise budget."

**Why Works**: First-person credibility + model news hook + BIP + cost angle

**Bucket**: BIP / Authority
**Format**: Short, no link needed
