**Data**: The pattern: AI agent calls in, interaction proceeds normally, only afterward does org realize their policies were built for humans.
**Template**: Contrarian + Production Reality (A3 template from content angle library)
**Bucket**: Authority
**Angle**: Call center AI — 7yr expertise differentiator

### 3. AI Agents Mainstream — But 40% Will Be Scrapped

**Data**: $7.8B market (2025) → $52B by 2030. 65% of CEOs look to agents to transform entire business model. But: operationalization gap kills projects.
**Template**: Comparative tension (growth vs failure)
**Bucket**: Authority / Shareability
**Angle**: Agentic AI enterprise reality — connects to 7yr production AI expertise
