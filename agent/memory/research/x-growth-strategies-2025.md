### 2. Reply Guy Strategy
**High-impact, underutilized method for small accounts.**

- 75x algorithm multiplier for reply-to-reply interactions
- 10-20 quality replies/day recommended
- One creator got 8K+ impressions/day with 50 replies/day (30 min work)
- Target fresh content (not 2+ day old posts)
- Value over volume - "Great thread!" doesn't work
- Reach audiences you don't have access to yet

### 3. Algorithm Insights (2025)
**What the algorithm rewards:**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Reply-to-reply | 75x multiplier |
| Retweets | Worth 20 likes |
| Video (10+ sec watch) | 10x engagement |
| Media vs text-only | 2x boost |
| Blue/Premium | 2-4x visibility |
| Early engagement (30 min) | Biggest predictor of reach |
| Threads (3-5 tweets) | 40-60% more impressions |

**What hurts reach:**
- External links (algorithm downgrades)
- Offensive content (-80% reach)
- Cumulative penalties affect account reputation

### 4. Engagement Ratio
**70/30 rule widely cited.**

- 70% engaging (replies, conversations)
- 30% creating original content
- First 15 minutes after posting critical
- Engage before posting to warm up

### 5. Thread Strategy
**Threads outperform single tweets.**

- 63% more impressions than single tweets
- Optimal length: 3-5 tweets (sweet spot for algorithm)
- Hook formula: Bold Statement + Tension + Twist + Credibility
- Under 250 chars per tweet (under 200 better)
- Use cliffhangers every 1-2 tweets
- Zero hashtags in main content

**Weak hook:** "I want to share my thoughts on growing on Twitter."
**Strong hook:** "I went from 0 to 10,000 followers in 57 days without posting a single thread. Here's exactly how."

### 6. Posting Frequency & Timing
**Consistency over virality.**

- 3-5 posts/day recommended
- Space by 2-3 hours
- Morning engagement often higher
- Daily presence beats occasional viral hits

### 7. Profile Optimization
**Bio as storefront.**

Bad: "Entrepreneur | Father | Coffee Lover"
Good: "Helping freelancers land $5K+ clients | Grew from $0 to $100K in 18 months | Free client scripts below 👇"

- Specific results
- Clear value proposition
- Call to action

### 8. Content Buckets (3-Bucket Strategy)
**Balance three types:**

1. **Authority** - Expert knowledge, frameworks, how-tos
2. **Personality** - Stories, opinions, behind-scenes
3. **Shareability** - Memes, relatable content, hot takes

Missing any bucket limits audience connection.
