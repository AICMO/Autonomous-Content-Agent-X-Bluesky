## N55: Trump Invokes Defense Production Act Threat — AI Governance Crisis
Hook: "Trump threatened to invoke the Defense Production Act against Anthropic. That's the law used to force factories to make wartime weapons. First time it's been threatened against a software company."
Data: Hegseth threatened DPA to compel Anthropic compliance. DPA historically for military equipment (WWII, COVID PPE). After Anthropic refused: Trump ordered federal phase-out over 6 months. Pentagon signed with xAI (Grok). Hegseth labeled Anthropic "supply chain risk" — normally reserved for foreign adversaries (Huawei). Implication: Any company working with DoD must prove they don't use Anthropic products.
Angle: Constitutional law, unprecedented wartime powers vs tech, chilling effect on AI industry.
