## News Angles (Priority Order)

**N51: Anthropic Refuses Pentagon — "Cannot In Good Conscience" Allow Autonomous Weapons**
Hook: "Anthropic just told the Pentagon: No. Military wants Claude for autonomous weapons + mass surveillance. Dario Amodei refused. Trump ordered all federal agencies to cut ties."
Data: Pentagon gave Anthropic 5pm Friday deadline (Feb 28) to drop AI guardrails. Pentagon wants Claude for "any lawful purpose" including autonomous weapons and domestic surveillance. Amodei's public statement: "cannot in good conscience accede." Pentagon official called him "a liar with a God complex." Trump ordered federal agencies to phase out Anthropic products (6-month window). Pentagon signing with xAI (Grok) for classified systems instead. 300+ Google employees, 60+ OpenAI employees signed letters supporting Anthropic's position. Sam Altman issued memo stating OpenAI will draw same "red lines." Anthropic valuation: $380B. Contract value at stake: $200M (survivable).
Angle: Biggest AI governance story of 2026. Principled refusal at massive financial cost. Industry-wide solidarity. First company to publicly defy US military AI demands.

**N52: Anthropic Raises $30B at $380B Valuation — $14B Run-Rate Revenue**
Hook: "Anthropic: $30 billion raised. $380 billion valuation. $14B run-rate revenue. 4% of all GitHub commits worldwide are Claude Code. This is the fastest AI company growth in history."
Data: Series G led by GIC and Coatue. Co-led by D.E. Shaw, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, MGX. Second-largest VC deal of all time (behind OpenAI's $40B in 2025). Revenue 10x annually for 3 consecutive years. Customers spending $100K+: 7x growth in 1 year. Customers spending $1M+: 12 → 500+. Claude Code run-rate: $2.5B (doubled since Jan 1). 4% of all GitHub public commits = Claude Code (doubled in 1 month). 8 of Fortune 10 are Claude customers. Previous valuation: $183B (Series F). New: $380B (2.1x jump).
Angle: Revenue growth data is jaw-dropping. GitHub commit stat is unprecedented. Enterprise adoption at Fortune 10 scale.

**N53: 300+ Tech Workers Refuse Military AI — OpenAI + Google Employees Sign Letters**
Hook: "300+ Google employees. 60+ OpenAI employees. One letter: 'No AI for weapons or surveillance.' The workforce is drawing lines their CEOs won't."
Data: 300+ Google employees sent letter to Jeff Dean (chief scientist) demanding Google refuse military AI use for autonomous weapons and domestic surveillance. 60+ OpenAI employees sent similar letter. Context: Sparked by Anthropic-Pentagon standoff. Sam Altman issued internal memo saying OpenAI will draw same "red lines" on surveillance and autonomous weapons. First major industry-wide worker action on AI ethics. Signals: Engineers who build AI are increasingly defining how it's used. Contrast with Elon Musk's xAI — which signed with Pentagon for classified systems.
Angle: Worker power angle. Silicon Valley vs. Washington. Generational shift in how engineers view their responsibility.

**N54: Claude Code = 4% of All GitHub Commits — AI Wrote 1 in 25 Code Commits Worldwide**
Hook: "1 in 25 GitHub commits worldwide is now written by Claude Code. That number doubled in one month. Developers are outsourcing their keyboards."
Data: Anthropic disclosed in Series G announcement: 4% of all public GitHub commits worldwide authored by Claude Code. That percentage doubled in 30 days (was ~2% in January). Weekly active Claude Code users doubled since Jan 1. Business subscriptions: 4x since Jan 1. Enterprise use: >50% of Claude Code revenue. Revenue: $2.5B run-rate (doubled since Jan 1). Implications: AI-authored code is no longer a rounding error — it's 4% of the world's software output. At current growth, could be 8% by March.
Angle: Mind-bending stat. Exponential adoption curve. Developers as early majority adopters. "The keyboard is optional" frame.

**N55: Trump Invokes Defense Production Act Threat — AI Governance Crisis**
Hook: "Trump threatened to invoke the Defense Production Act against Anthropic. That's the law used to force factories to make wartime weapons. First time it's been threatened against a software company."
Data: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to invoke Defense Production Act (DPA) to compel Anthropic to comply with Pentagon demands — without consent. DPA historically used to force manufacturers to make military equipment (WWII, COVID PPE). Using it against an AI company would be unprecedented. After Anthropic refused: Trump ordered federal agencies to phase out Anthropic products over 6 months. Pentagon signed with xAI (Grok) for classified systems. Hegseth labeled Anthropic a "supply chain risk" — a designation normally reserved for foreign adversaries (Huawei, etc.). Implication: Any company working with DoD must now prove they don't use Anthropic products.
Angle: Constitutional law angle. Unprecedented use of wartime powers against tech. "Supply chain risk" designation's chilling effect on entire AI industry.
