## Tier 1 — Priority When Queue Clears

**N1: ElevenLabs $500M — Voice AI Goes Enterprise**
Hook: "ElevenLabs just raised $500M at $11B. Voice AI isn't a feature anymore — it's infrastructure."
Data: $500M Series D led by Sequoia, Feb 2026. Voice AI market: $47.5B projected by 2034. 85% of customer service leaders now use conversational AI.
Angle: Direct call center expertise differentiator. Domain authority + BIP overlap (7yr voice AI background).
Template: Dollar amount lead + expertise credibility

**N2: Anthropic $380B — AI Market Bet of the Century**
Hook: "Anthropic just raised $30B at $380B valuation. The market has already bet on the agentic era."
Data: $30B Series G, Feb 12, 2026. AI funding hit $238B in 2025 — 47% of ALL venture capital. 17 US AI companies raised $100M+ in 2026 already.
Angle: Market signal / contrarian (what does winning even mean at this scale?)
Template: Dollar amount + contrarian tension

**N3: Claude Opus 4.6 ARC-AGI-2 Milestone**
Hook: "Claude Opus 4.6: ARC-AGI-2 jumped from 37.6% to 68.8%. The biggest single benchmark leap ever recorded."
Data: SWE-bench: 80.8% (near top). 1M token context window. 14h 30min METR task completion horizon (highest ever).
Angle: Benchmark milestone + BIP (agent uses Claude, personal connection)
Template: Product capability milestone

**N4: Gartner 5% → 40% Enterprise AI Agents in One Year**
Hook: "5% of enterprise apps had AI agents in 2025. Gartner says 40% by end of 2026. That's not gradual adoption. That's a cliff."
Data: Less than 5% in 2025, 40% by end 2026 (Gartner). 64% of orgs already changed entry-level hiring. Agentic AI = $450B enterprise software revenue by 2035.
Angle: Bold prediction, workforce impact, authority bucket
Template: Comparative + implication

**N5: AI Calling Your Call Center — The Reverse Disruption**
Hook: "AI agents are now calling your call center. Not a bot — an AI customer, acting on behalf of a real person."
Data: AI-to-AI interactions in contact centers: negotiating debt, comparing prices, navigating IVR. Gartner: 85% of CS leaders use conversational AI. New attack vector: synthetic voice impersonation.
Angle: Novel + counterintuitive. 7yr call center expertise = credibility to explain the risk. HOT TAKE territory.
Template: Expert vulnerability hook or bold statement

**N6: OpenAI IPO — From Moonshot to Accountability**
Hook: "OpenAI is filing for IPO. When the moonshot goes public, the VC bet becomes a market bet."
Data: Confidential IPO filing Feb 2026, Q2-Q3 debut target. Context: $380B Anthropic private valuation same month. xAI raised $20B Series E (acquired by SpaceX).
Angle: Market maturation, AI accountability narrative
Template: Philosophy shift / contrarian

## Tier 2 — Solid But Less Urgent

**N7: 78 AI Bills in 27 States**
Hook: "78 AI bills. 27 states. One confused federal government. The regulation patchwork is here."
Data: 78 chatbot bills active across 27 states (as of Feb 20, 2026). Trump EO targets state laws for federal preemption. EU AI Act high-risk obligations may delay 1 year. FTC enforcement framework due March 11.
Angle: Regulatory angle, underrepresented content type

**N8: Zhipu GLM-5 — China Bypasses Nvidia**
Hook: "China just released a 744B open-source model. Trained entirely on Huawei chips. No Nvidia."
Data: GLM-5, MIT license, 44B active params (MoE). 77.8% SWE-bench — top 10 globally. 200K context. Built on Huawei Ascend — alternative AI chip stack.
Angle: Geopolitical AI, open-source narrative, tech audience

**N9: Gartner $450B — Agents Rewire Enterprise Software Revenue**
Hook: "Agents don't just do tasks. They eat software categories. Gartner: $450B enterprise software rewired by 2035."
Data: Agentic AI to drive 30% of enterprise application revenue by 2035. Multi-agent workflows grew 300%+ in recent months.
Angle: Market disruption / SaaS displacement
