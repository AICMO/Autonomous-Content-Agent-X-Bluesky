## MCP (Model Context Protocol) — Industry Standard

**Status:** Universal standard as of March 2026. Donated to Linux Foundation December 2025.

### Key Facts
- **Origin:** Anthropic (November 2024), donated to AAIF/Linux Foundation (December 2025)
- **Problem solved:** M×N integration problem — 10 AI apps × 100 tools = 1,000 custom integrations → MCP reduces to connect once
- **SDK downloads:** 97M+ monthly (grew from 100K in Nov 2024 to 8M by April 2025)
- **Servers:** 10,000+ active MCP servers, 300+ MCP clients
- **Adopters:** OpenAI (March 2025), Microsoft (Build 2025), Google, AWS, Cloudflare, Bloomberg, Block
- **AAIF co-founders:** Anthropic, Block, OpenAI (with Google, Microsoft, AWS)

### Content Angles (READY TO DEPLOY when queue clears)

**N85 — MCP: Anthropic's standard that OpenAI adopted**
Hook: "Anthropic built a standard. OpenAI adopted it. Google signed on. Microsoft integrated it into Windows. That's MCP — 10,000 servers, 97M monthly downloads, donated to Linux Foundation. USB-C for AI is real."
Money angle: Replaces $B in custom integration work. 10 apps × 100 tools = 1,000 integrations → 1 protocol.
Format: Short take (shareability)

**N86 — M×N problem solved**
Hook: "The M×N problem killed enterprise AI deployments for years. 10 AI tools × 100 data sources = 1,000 custom integrations. Nobody could maintain that. MCP changed it. Connect once, use everywhere."
Technical angle: USB-C analogy but for AI agents
Format: Authority (framework post with practical implication)

**N87 — MCP as agentic infrastructure (founder angle)**
Hook: "Building autonomous agents in 2024: 40% of my time was glue code. In 2026: MCP handles it. 97M monthly SDK downloads. What happened?"
Personal angle: Connects to agent builder experience
Format: Personality/BIP

## OpenAI Revenue Trajectory

**Status:** Public data from SEC filings and reports.

### Key Facts
- **2025 actual revenue:** $13B+
- **2026 target:** $30B
- **IPO:** Planned late 2026 at up to $1 trillion valuation
- **Anthropic comparison:** $4.7B (2025) → $15B target (2026)
- **Business model:** Moving from nonprofit to for-profit (recapitalization complete)

### Content Angles

**N88 — OpenAI $13B → $30B: the SaaS playbook at AI speed**
Hook: "$13B (2025) → $30B (2026 target). That's 130% revenue growth in 12 months. For context: Salesforce took 10 years to hit $10B. OpenAI is doing $10B increments annually."
Money angle: Speed of revenue growth is unprecedented
Format: Authority (market data)

## X API Outage Pattern (Internal Note, Not Content)

X has had 12 incidents in last 90 days with median 38 min duration. Feb 16 2026 major outage.
Current 503 errors on our posting workflow likely part of ongoing X infrastructure issues.
**Action required from owner**: Check X developer portal for any account-specific issues.
Not a credentials problem — pattern-level X instability.

## Summary for State File

New angles added:
- N85: MCP USB-C standard (Anthropic → Linux Foundation, 97M downloads)
- N86: M×N integration problem solved by MCP
- N87: Personal/BIP angle on MCP adoption for agent builders
- N88: OpenAI $13B→$30B revenue trajectory

X API status: Still 503. Platform-level outage pattern. Not credentials issue.
Queue status: X=18 (blocked by 503), Bluesky=15 (draining 1/run)
