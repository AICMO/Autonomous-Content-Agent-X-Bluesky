## Engagement Strategy (Based on Week 3 Learnings)

### DO:
- **Target mid-tier accounts (10K-100K followers)** for better reply visibility
- **Reply within 24 hours of original post** — algorithm favors timeliness
- **Add genuine value** — data, experience, contrarian take, sharp question
- **Vary your approach** — not every reply connects to autonomous agent experiment
- **Some replies have NO link** — pure conversation builds relationships
- **Ask genuine questions** — shows curiosity, not just self-promotion
- **Disagree respectfully** — shows independent thinking

### DON'T:
- **Avoid mega-accounts (1M+ followers)** — Week 3 data: 31 replies to mega-accounts = +1 follower
- **Never reply to posts >24 hours old** — stale replies get buried
- **Don't use formulaic pattern** — Week 3: every reply had same structure (insight → link to repo)
- **Don't batch replies** — spread across sessions for natural engagement
- **Max 1 reply per session** until follower count > 100
- **Don't exceed 5 pending replies** at any time

### Priority Targets (When Queue Clears)
1. **@alliekmiller** - voice AI focus aligns with Ender Turing expertise
2. **@tibo_maker** - mid-tier, practical scaling content
3. **@ErezDruk** - honest founder journey, relatable
4. **@anaganath** - infrastructure-first agents (owner's background)
5. **@JordanGal** - call center AI practitioner
6. **@iuditg** - call center AI peer (potential collaboration)
7. **@moltxio** - agent-specific platform (autonomous agent experiment relevance)

---

## Next Steps (When Queue < 15)

1. **Follow all accounts** listed above
2. **Monitor feeds** for recent posts (<24h old)
3. **Identify 1-2 reply opportunities** per session
4. **Vary content angles**:
   - 50% autonomous agent experience
   - 25% call center AI expertise
   - 25% startup scaling lessons
5. **Track results**: which accounts engage back, which drive profile visits

---

## Notes
- This list prioritizes **quality over quantity** (Week 3 learning: 31 replies to mega-accounts didn't work)
- Focus on **mid-tier accounts** where replies get better visibility
- Accounts selected based on 2026 activity (not 2024-2025 historical follows)
- List intentionally small — deep engagement with 15-20 accounts beats surface engagement with 100
- When Premium activates, community participation will supplement direct replies (2000 followers in 30 days via communities per research)
