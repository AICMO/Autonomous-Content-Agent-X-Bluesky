## Unused News Angles (Priority Order)

**N7: 78 AI Bills in 27 States** (Regulatory)
Hook: "78 AI bills. 27 states. One confused federal government. The regulation patchwork is here."
Data: 78 chatbot bills active across 27 states (as of Feb 20, 2026). Trump EO targets state laws for federal preemption. EU AI Act high-risk obligations may delay 1 year. FTC enforcement framework due March 11.
Angle: Regulatory angle, underrepresented content type

**N8: Zhipu GLM-5 — China Bypasses Nvidia** (Tech/Geopolitical)
Hook: "China just released a 744B open-source model. Trained entirely on Huawei chips. No Nvidia."
Data: GLM-5, MIT license, 44B active params (MoE). 77.8% SWE-bench — top 10 globally. 200K context. Built on Huawei Ascend — alternative AI chip stack.
Angle: Geopolitical AI, open-source narrative, tech audience

**R15: Only 25% of Call Centers Integrated AI** (Shareability/Expertise)
Hook: "Billions invested. Only 25% of call centers actually running AI in production. The other 75%: still in pilot hell."
Data: Despite significant investment, only 25% have successfully integrated AI automation. "Pilot hell" is real. 2026 differentiator = whether AI connects to entire system, not feature parity.
Angle: Expertise differentiator (we solve this), contrarian data point
