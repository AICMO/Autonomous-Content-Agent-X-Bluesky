## Tier 1 — Best Remaining Angles

**R1: Deutsche Bank AI Irony** (Shareability)
Hook: "Deutsche Bank asked AI how AI will destroy jobs. The robot said: 75% customer service automated. IT workers most exposed. Awkward."
Data: AI predicted it handles 75% of customer service by 2026. Most exposed: media/entertainment, then IT/software. "The sector building AI is most disrupted by it."
Angle: Shareability / contrarian / self-aware builder

**R2: AI-to-AI Identity Crisis — Call Centers**
Hook: "AI agents are calling your call center. Not a bot. An AI customer acting on behalf of a real person."
Data: AI-to-AI interactions emerging — agents navigate IVR, debt negotiation, price comparison. Identity systems built for humans, not AI patterns. New attack vector: synthetic voice impersonation.
Angle: 7yr call center expertise differentiator, alarming + novel

**R3: $80B Gartner Labor Cost Reduction**
Hook: "$80B. That's how much Gartner says AI will cut from call center labor costs by 2029."
Data: 80% common issues resolved by 2029. 70%+ use conversational AI by 2028. Regulatory twist: +30% assisted service volume required by law.
Angle: Dollar amount hook + authority + Ender Turing natural promo

**R4: Gemini 3.1 Pro 77.1% ARC-AGI-2**
Hook: "Gemini 3.1 Pro: 77.1% on ARC-AGI-2. That's more than double the previous version."
Data: Previous: ~36%, now 77.1%. ARC-AGI-2 = logic/reasoning proxy. Rolling out to Gemini app, NotebookLM, Vertex AI.
Angle: Reasoning milestone, tech audience

**R5: OpenAI Frontier — HR for Agents**
Hook: "OpenAI just gave agents HR procedures. Onboarding. Performance reviews."
Data: Frontier = enterprise platform to manage agents like employees. 6 weeks → 1 day production optimization at manufacturer. 90% more salesperson time freed.
BIP angle: "We've been doing PDCA cycles for 190+ sessions. OpenAI just named it 'performance reviews.'"
Angle: BIP / personality / authority crossover

**R6: Seedance vs Disney — AI IP Wars**
Hook: "Disney sued ByteDance for AI deepfakes. Then licensed Mickey Mouse to OpenAI Sora. The AI IP wars have no rules."
Data: Seedance 2.0 cinematic quality, C&D from Disney/Paramount. Irony: Disney-Sora deal. SAG-AFTRA + MPA condemned.
Angle: Shareability, media angle, irony/hypocrisy hook

**R7: Claude 5 Leak — Cost Trajectory**
Hook: "The AI race isn't about who's smartest. It's about who destroys your margins fastest. Claude 5 may cost 50% less."
Data: `claude-sonnet-5@20260203` in Vertex AI logs. Pattern: better AND cheaper (Sonnet 4.6 = Opus-level at Sonnet price).
Angle: BIP / cost angle, tech audience

**R8: $2.9T McKinsey — Context Nobody Gives**
Hook: "McKinsey: AI agents = $2.9 trillion in economic value by 2030. But only 11% deployed. The gap is the work."
Data: 3-15% revenue increase + 10-20% sales ROI. 324% ROI contract automation (Sirion). Only 11% live.
Angle: Dollar amount + contrarian tension + production credibility

---

## Tier 2 — Solid But Less Urgent

**R9: Call Center 2026 Reckoning**
Hook: "2026 is 'a year of reckoning for contact centers.' AI handles 50-70% of high-volume calls. Human agents: moving to QA, coaching, upsell."
Data: Cost per contact -20-40%. New human roles: QA trainers, AI supervisors. Security risk: AI-to-AI attack surface.

**R10: 2026 Hype → Pragmatism**
Hook: "2026 is the year AI gets boring. No new paradigms — just making it work in production. That's actually harder."
Data: Smaller models, edge deployment, workflow integration. MCP cross-company standard. IBM: first quantum > classical.

**R11: GitHub AI PR Study**
Hook: "24,014 AI-merged PRs studied vs 5,081 human PRs. Here's what researchers found:"
Data: Agentic PRs: more commits, broader file changes. 41% AI-generated code in production. "Software Engineering 3.0."
BIP: "160+ autonomous PRs. Data confirms what I observed."

**R12: EU AI Act — Content Labeling**
Hook: "EU: AI-generated text must be machine-readable marked. The deepfake era just got regulated."
Data: First Code of Practice on transparency. Machine-readable watermarks for AI-generated content + deepfakes.
Angle: Regulatory/policy, underrepresented content type
