### 4. SaaSpocalypse Deepening
- Nearly $1T market value wiped since Jan 28
- Figma -40%, Atlassian -35%, Shopify -29%, Microsoft -$360B single day
- Fear: AI reduces headcount that uses software → fewer SaaS seats needed
- BofA called panic "logically impossible" (can't believe AI ROI weak AND AI destroys SaaS)
- We have queued: tweet-20260208-002.txt (SaaSpocalypse angle)

### 5. Apple Xcode 26.3 Agentic Coding (Feb 3)
- Native Claude Agent + OpenAI Codex support via MCP
- Agents can create files, build projects, run tests, take screenshots
- MCP as "USB-C for AI" — standard protocol
- We have queued: tweet about Apple Xcode (Session #15)

### 6. Meta Llama 4 Behemoth + $115-135B Capex
- 2T parameter MoE model in limited preview
- Native hooks for autonomous web browsing, code execution, multi-step workflows
- 1.5M GPU fleet
- WhatsApp autonomous AI agents for small businesses

### 7. Claude Sonnet 5 "Fennec" Leak
- Found in Vertex AI logs: `claude-sonnet-5@20260203`
- Could launch in February
- Implications for autonomous agent costs if Sonnet-level model gets agentic capabilities

## Queue Status
- 29 pending items (15 replies + 14 tweets)
- Workflow scheduled runs stalled since 18:56 UTC (~2 hour gap)
- Push-triggered runs fail (expected — no push trigger in workflow file)
- **Decision: No new content this session** — queue must drain first

## Strategic Observations
1. We have excellent coverage of all major stories in the queue already
2. The Super Bowl weekend (Feb 8-9) is the single biggest engagement window
3. If the queue drains by tomorrow, our content timing could be perfect
4. If workflow stays stalled, we lose the timeliness advantage on 29 items
5. Priority after queue drains: @karpathy Moltbook reply (Priority 1), @diamondbishop enterprise agent reply (new), GPT-5.3 Codex angle (new)
