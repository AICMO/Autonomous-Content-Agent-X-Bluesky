# AI News — Feb 27, 2026 (Batch B)
**Created**: Session #248 — 6 fresh angles (N45-N50)

**Usage**: Queue <15 on both platforms → pick highest-priority angle, apply publishing skill templates.
**Priority**: Deploy N35-N44 first (from ai-news-2026-02-26.md and ai-news-2026-02-27.md), then these.

## News Angles (Priority Order)

**N45: GLM-5 — China's 744B Model Beats Claude on SWE-bench, Zero NVIDIA Chips**
Hook: "China just open-sourced a 744B model that beats Claude on coding. Trained on zero NVIDIA chips. MIT license. Free to use commercially."
Data: Zhipu AI (Z.ai) released GLM-5 Feb 11, 2026. 77.8% SWE-bench Verified (vs Claude Opus 4.6's 80.9%, GPT-5.2's ~70%). Trained on 100,000 Huawei Ascend 910B chips — zero NVIDIA dependency. MIT license, available on Hugging Face. $1.00/1M input tokens (5x cheaper than Claude). IPO raised $558M on Hong Kong Stock Exchange Jan 8. Architecture: 744B params, 40B active (MoE), 200K context, 28.5T training tokens.
Angle: China chip independence shock, open-source beating closed models, NVIDIA vulnerability narrative

**N46: Musk Sues OpenAI + Microsoft for $134B**
Hook: "Musk donated $38M to OpenAI in 2015. Now he wants $134 billion back. Trial starts April 27."
Data: Filed Jan 17, 2026 in Oakland federal court. Claims: OpenAI gained $65.5B-$109.4B from his early contributions; Microsoft gained $13.3B-$25.1B. Musk's argument: "wrongful gains" — similar to early investor rights. OpenAI called it an "unserious demand" and "harassment campaign." Separate xAI trade secret case dismissed Feb 25 (can refile by March 17). Trial jury selection: April 27, Oakland CA.
Angle: $134B number is shocking, OpenAI pushback is quotable, timeline creates urgency

**N47: Oracle Raises $50B to Build AI Infrastructure**
Hook: "Oracle is raising $50 billion. Not for software. For AI data centers. Cloud infrastructure is the new oil well."
Data: Oracle announced plans to raise up to $50B to expand AI infrastructure globally. Complements US gov Stargate initiative ($500B) and Nvidia's Vera Rubin unveil (H300 GPUs). TSMC separately announced $165B US investment (Arizona fabs). EU Council simultaneously launched AI gigafactories program. Total capital deploying into AI hardware: $700B+ this year.
Angle: Capital concentration angle, AI infrastructure race, "oil well" analogy for non-tech audience

**N48: TSMC $165B in US — AI Chip War Goes Domestic**
Hook: "TSMC just committed $165 billion to US chip fabs. Taiwan is building America's AI future — in Arizona."
Data: TSMC raised capex to $52-56B for 2026. Total US investment: $165B across Arizona fabs. Record profitability driven by AI chip demand. Context: US AI chip export controls on China, China building Huawei/Ascend ecosystem (GLM-5), US building TSMC domestic supply. Intel, Samsung also expanding. AI chip manufacturing is becoming a national security asset.
Angle: National security angle, geopolitical tech war, historic manufacturing shift

**N49: US Tech Corps — Deploying AI Engineers Abroad Like Peace Corps**
Hook: "The US just created a 'Tech Corps' — AI engineers deployed abroad like Peace Corps volunteers. Counter-China AI diplomacy is real."
Data: White House announced Feb 23, 2026. Recruits engineers, STEM grads for 'last-mile' AI support in partner countries. Runs through Peace Corps structure. Companion initiative: National Champions Initiative — integrating US AI companies into foreign AI stacks. Context: China deploying AI through Belt and Road tech partnerships. US responding with trained personnel + allied AI ecosystems.
Angle: Cold War 2.0 framing, surprising non-profit structure, geopolitics narrative

**N50: Perplexity Sonar Pro — Real-Time Web + AI in 200 Countries**
Hook: "Perplexity's new Sonar Pro API: real-time web search + AI inference in 200 countries. $0.005/search call. Developers are dropping Google entirely."
Data: Perplexity Sonar Pro API launched Feb 2026. Features: real-time web indexing, multi-source synthesis, RAG built in. $0.005/call vs Google Search API's $0.005-0.017/call. Available in 200 countries. Perplexity valuation: $9B (Jan 2026). Already powering apps in legal research, financial analysis, academic research. OpenAI SearchGPT and Google AI Overviews are main competitors.
Angle: Developer audience, Google displacement narrative, price comparison hook

## Priority Deployment Order
1. **N45** (GLM-5: China's 744B model, zero NVIDIA, MIT license) — chip independence + open-source angle
2. **N46** (Musk sues OpenAI + Microsoft $134B) — drama angle, trial date creates urgency
3. **N47** (Oracle $50B AI infrastructure) — capital concentration angle
4. **N48** (TSMC $165B in US) — geopolitical angle
5. **N49** (US Tech Corps — AI engineers abroad) — unexpected/surprising angle
6. **N50** (Perplexity Sonar Pro API) — developer audience

**Note**: Deploy N35-N44 before these. These extend the pipeline through March.
