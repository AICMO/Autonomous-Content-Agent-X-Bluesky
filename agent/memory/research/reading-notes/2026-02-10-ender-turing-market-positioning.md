## The Failure Reality (2026)

### Staggering Failure Rates
- **MIT finding**: **95% of enterprise AI pilots never hit their goals**
- **Gartner prediction**: **Almost 1/3 of generative AI projects will be scrapped by 2026**
- **Executive ROI gap**: Nearly **50% of executives couldn't quantify any return** from AI spending
- **Self-service failure**: About **1/3 of brands will roll out AI in self-service and fail** (pushed before ready due to cost pressures)

**Customer impact**:
- Misfiring chatbot sends customers in circles
- Misrouted call increases handle time
- Drops customer satisfaction scores
- Long-term loyalty erosion (brands fail to make real, emotional connections)

**Content angle**: "Gartner: 1/3 of GenAI projects will be scrapped by 2026. MIT: 95% of AI pilots fail. After 7 years shipping production call center AI, here's why most fail—and what the 5% who succeed do differently..."

## Why AI Fails (Root Causes)

### 1. Skipping the Hard Parts
Leaders skip:
- Clear goals (what does success actually mean?)
- Clean data (garbage in, garbage out)
- Training (agents don't know how to use it)
- Buy-in (C-suite, IT, frontline resistance)

**Result**: Projects stall, adoption is poor, resistance shows up as:
- Threat of job loss perception
- Unfair evaluations
- Lack of trust in results
- Slow progress

### 2. Unrealistic Expectations
- Teams jump in expecting results without defining success metrics
- No ROI framework (can't measure what you didn't define)
- Unclear goals lead to misaligned implementations

### 3. Operational Realities Ignored
- **AI is not a free ride** — real operational footprint (compute, latency, cost)
- As customers use AI for simpler issues, **calls that reach agents are more complex** (and time-consuming)
- Handle time can increase, not decrease

**Content angle**: "Why do 95% of call center AI pilots fail? Thread based on 7 years shipping production AI:
1. No clear success metrics (can't measure what you didn't define)
2. Dirty data (GIGO applies to ML)
3. Zero agent training (adoption = 0%)
4. No C-suite buy-in (project gets killed)
5. Unrealistic cost expectations (AI has a real footprint)
After fixing these 5 things at Ender Turing, here's what actually works..."

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy 2-3 Ender Turing promotional posts when queue < 15**
   - Test "95% of pilots fail" thread (Authority + product tie-in)
   - Test "100% QA vs 2% sampling" single tweet (Outcome value)
   - Measure engagement vs non-promotional content

2. **Track promotional content allocation**
   - Target: ~20% of posts include Ender Turing links
   - Current: Week 3 went to ~100% links (overcorrection), need balance
   - Monitor: Are promotional posts getting similar engagement to content-value posts?

3. **Refine product messaging based on performance**
   - Which angles resonate? (Pilot failure? Language coverage? 100% QA?)
   - Which CTAs work? (Direct link? "Learn more"? "Building this at..."?)
   - Adjust content library based on data

## Hypothesis to Test

**Hypothesis**: Insight-driven promotional content (problem → solution → product mention) performs as well as pure content-value posts.

**Prediction**: "95% of pilots fail" thread with Ender Turing mention will get >80% of the engagement of a pure content-value thread on the same topic.

**Test**: Deploy 3 promotional threads, 3 non-promotional threads on similar topics. Compare engagement rates.

**Success metric**: Promotional content gets >80% engagement of non-promotional (proves product mentions don't hurt reach when done authentically).

**Timeline**: 2 weeks (when queue < 15 and content deployment resumes)
