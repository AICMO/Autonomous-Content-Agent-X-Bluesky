## 1. Karpathy: From Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering

### Timeline
- **Feb 2025**: Karpathy coins "vibe coding" (throwaway tweet, unpredictable engagement)
- **Feb 2026**: One-year anniversary, introduces "agentic engineering"

### Definition: Agentic Engineering
> "Agentic engineering: 'agentic' because the new default is that you are not writing the code directly 99% of the time, you are orchestrating agents who do and acting as oversight — 'engineering' to emphasize that there is an art & science and expertise to it."

### Evolution
- **Then (2025)**: LLM capability low enough for fun throwaway projects, demos, explorations
- **Now (2026)**: Programming via LLM agents increasingly becoming default workflow for professionals, with more oversight and scrutiny
- **Prediction**: "In 2026, we're likely to see continued improvements on both the model layer and the new agent layer."

### Key Insight
- **80% shift in weeks**: Manual → agent coding (Dec 2025 phase shift)
- **Atrophy concerns**: Skills degrading as agents handle more
- **Professional standard**: Agentic engineering = systematic, rigorous, reliable (not experimental)

### Content Angle Opportunities
- **Authority**: "From vibe coding to agentic engineering: what changed in 12 months"
- **Vulnerability**: "My code skills are atrophying. Here's why I'm not worried."
- **Contrarian**: "Agentic engineering isn't the future. It's already the default."

## 2. Agentic Workflow Best Practices (2026 State of the Art)

### Core Principle
> "Match the architecture to the business case and give the system the smallest amount of freedom that still delivers the outcome."

### Workflow Categories (2026)
1. **Single agent workflows** (start here)
2. **Hierarchical multi-agent workflows** (separation of duties)
3. **Sequential pipeline workflows** (multi-step processes)
4. **Decentralized swarm workflows** (parallelism)

### Start Simple Philosophy
Most teams begin with a single agent, adding multi-agent structure only when there's a clear need for:
- Parallelism
- Separation of duties
- Better reliability
- Tighter permission boundaries

### 2026 Focus Areas
> "Effort should be placed into tool design, grounding, explicit state, and observability - that is what makes agents dependable in 2026."

NOT: Model sophistication
YES: Tool design, grounding, explicit state, observability

### Professional Standard Shift
- **Not fringe experiment**: Agentic coding becoming default way professionals build software
- **Oversight + scrutiny**: Professionals use agents WITH more oversight (not blind delegation)
- **Professional standard**: Systematic, rigorous, reliable

### Parallel Execution (Emerging 2026)
- Apps like Conductor, Verdent AI support parallel task running
- More apps adding parallel workflow support in 2026

### Critical Success Factor
> "The key differentiator isn't the sophistication of the AI models - it's the willingness to redesign workflows rather than simply layering agents onto legacy processes."

### Reality Check
- Companies CAN build economically valuable agents RIGHT NOW with current technology
- Companies ARE building agentic workflows that do a lot of work autonomously at high accuracy levels

### Content Angle Opportunities
- **Authority**: "Most teams overcomplicate agentic workflows. Here's the right way to start."
- **Contrarian**: "The best agentic workflows use the dumbest architecture that works."
- **BIP**: "160 PRs in. Here's what I learned about tool design vs model sophistication."

## 3. Specification Engineering (Emerging Concept, Early 2026)

### What It Is
Specification-driven development where specs become:
- **Shared source of truth** (not documentation that drifts)
- **Living, executable artifacts** (not static documents)
- **Evolving with the project** (not written once, forgotten)

### How It Works
1. **Specs become authoritative**: Declared intent is the source of truth
2. **AI generates code from specs**: Transforms intent into validated code
3. **Architectural determinism**: No drift between spec and implementation
4. **Continuous enforcement**: Specs continuously validated

### Early Adoption
- **Zencoder**: Shows early promise, especially in spec-driven workflows
- **GitHub AI team**: Promotes spec-driven development
- **Emerging 2026 trend**: Not mainstream yet, but gaining traction

### Swyx's Agent Formula
> "agent = llm + memory + planning + tools + while loop"

### Content Angle Opportunities
- **Authority**: "Specification Engineering: Why specs finally matter in 2026"
- **Contrarian**: "Prompt engineering is dead. Specification engineering is here."
- **BIP**: "How I use CLAUDE.md as executable specs for autonomous agents"
