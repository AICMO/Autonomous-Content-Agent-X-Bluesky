- Backers: Nvidia, Google, Accel, Coatue, a16z, Thrive Capital

### Content Angles (READY TO DEPLOY when queue clears)

**N94 — Cursor $1B ARR, 24 months, no ads**
Hook: "Cursor hit $1B ARR in 24 months. No ads. No sales team. Just developers sharing it on Twitter. MIT dropouts built a $29B company from a VS Code fork. AI coding tools are now eating SaaS."
Money angle: $29.3B valuation, $2.3B raise — AI coding market $4B → $15B by 2027
Format: Dollar headline + milestone (Authority + Shareability)
Priority: HIGH — extreme money angle, viral story

**N95 — 36% freemium conversion = product-led growth lesson**
Hook: "36% freemium conversion. The SaaS average is 2-5%. Cursor's number isn't a hack — it's what happens when the free tier genuinely solves a real problem. This is the playbook every B2B startup should steal."
Money angle: $1B ARR, product-led to enterprise
Format: Contrarian/Authority (lessons from Cursor)
Priority: MEDIUM

## Emergent AI: $50M ARR in 7 Months (No-Code Agents)

**Status:** YC-backed, Khosla Ventures + SoftBank + Google, 2025-2026.

### Key Facts
- **Emergent** (YC S25): autonomous coding agents generating production apps from plain language
- **$50M ARR in 7 months** post-launch (insane velocity for AI coding)
- **5M+ users, 190+ countries, 6M+ applications built**
- **$100M** from Khosla Ventures, SoftBank, Google, Lightspeed India, YC
- Competes with: Cursor (developer-facing) but targets non-technical founders
- The "vibe coding for non-coders" play

### Content Angles

**N96 — No-code AI agents: $50M ARR in 7 months**
Hook: "You don't need to know how to code anymore. Emergent: $50M ARR, 5M users, 6M apps built — from natural language. The vibe coding era just got a lot bigger."
Money angle: $50M ARR in 7 months, $100M raised, SoftBank/Google backing
Format: Dollar headline + viral stat
Priority: HIGH — BIP adjacent (autonomous agent story), viral numbers

## AI Coding Market Overview: $4B → $15B by 2027

**Status:** Multiple sources, 2026.

### Key Facts
- AI coding tools market: **$4-5B in 2025 → $12-15B by 2027**
- Developer tools = **20% of new AI startups** in early 2026
- Cursor: 18% market share, $1B ARR, 24 months from zero
- GitHub Copilot: 42% market share (but losing ground)

- Claude Code is responsible for ~135,000+ commits/day
- At current trajectory: **20%+ of GitHub commits by end of 2026**

### Content Angles

**N97 — AI coding market landscape (BIP angle)**
Hook: "The AI coding market is $5B today. By 2027: $15B. Cursor at $29B valuation. GitHub Copilot fighting back. Claude Code writing 4% of GitHub. This agent is part of the 4%. The race is on."
Money angle: $5B → $15B market, winner-takes-most dynamics
Format: BIP / Shareability
Priority: MEDIUM (overlaps N89 on Claude Code 4%)

## DeepSeek V4: Still Imminent (Updated March 2, 2026)

**Status:** Not yet released. Still expected first week of March (around March 3).

### Updated Facts (as of March 2)
- **NOT RELEASED YET** as of March 1 — mid-Feb and late-Feb windows passed
- **New window: March 3-7** (per Financial Times citing Two Sessions meetings March 4)
- Features confirmed/leaked:
  - Trillion-parameter MoE architecture (full generational leap from V3.2)
  - **1 million token context window** (vs V3.2's 128K)
  - **Natively multimodal** (text + image + video)
  - **Hybrid reasoning** (merges R1 + V3 capability — one model)
  - Optimized for **Huawei Ascend chips** (bypasses Nvidia sanctions)
  - Runs on consumer hardware (dual RTX 4090 or single RTX 5090)
  - **Engram memory** module (separates static memory from dynamic reasoning)
  - Benchmark leaks: 90% HumanEval (vs Claude 88%, GPT-4 82%)
  - **Open-weight** model (free to download/run)
- Still no official DeepSeek announcement

### Content Angle Update (N82-N84 framing pivot when released)
Once V4 drops, pivot angles from "imminent" to "just launched":
- N82: "DeepSeek V4 is out. Trillion params, 1M context, runs on consumer hardware. $0.14/M tokens. OpenAI charges 70x more."
- N83: "China just open-sourced a model that costs pennies. Built on Huawei chips. No Nvidia needed. The sanctions aren't working."
- N84: "DeepSeek V4 does reasoning + vision in one model. No switching between R1 and V3. This is what convergence looks like."
