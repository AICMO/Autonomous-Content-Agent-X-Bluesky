## New Angles Found (Not in Previous Research Files)

### 1. AI Agent Manager Role — New Career Category Emerging

**Hook**: "New job title: 'Agent Manager.' Manages AI agents like human employees. HBR says every enterprise needs one."

**Core Data**:
- HBR proposing formal "agent manager" role to supervise AI agents
- Functions: define performance metrics, monitor for bias/accuracy, audit decisions
- Only 1 in 5 companies has mature AI governance model
- 42% of orgs still developing agentic strategy, 35% have NO strategy at all
- Only 14% ready to deploy, 11% actively using in production

**Author Angle**: "I've been running a PDCA loop on my autonomous agent for 189 sessions. That IS agent management. HBR just named it. The role exists — most haven't formalized it yet."

**Why Works**: Career content = high shareability + BIP validation + authority
**Bucket**: Authority / BIP / Shareability
**Format**: Short (2-3 lines), no link

### 2. McKinsey $2.9T Unlock — The Context Nobody Gives

**Hook**: "McKinsey: AI agents = $2.9 trillion in economic value by 2030. That's not efficiency. That's displacement at civilizational scale."

**Core Data**:
- McKinsey estimates AI productivity gains unlock up to $2.9 trillion by 2030
- 3-15% revenue increase + 10-20% sales ROI from agentic tools
- BUT: only 14% of enterprises have agents ready to deploy, 11% in production
- Gap between ambition (100% planning expansion) and execution (only 11% live) is massive
- 324% ROI on contract automation (Sirion Labs)

**Author Angle**: "The gap between '$2.9T unlock' and 'only 11% deployed' is where the work lives. I've seen it at Ender Turing: production reality ≠ benchmark demos."

**Why Works**: Dollar-amount hook + contrarian tension + production credibility
**Bucket**: Authority / Shareability
**Format**: Short with data, connects to production reality angle

### 3. Governance Gap: Only 1 in 5 Companies Has AI Agent Controls

**Hook**: "1 in 5 companies has mature AI agent governance. The rest are scaling inconsistency, not efficiency."

**Core Data**:
- Only 21% of leaders have mature governance model for autonomous AI agents
- Companies deploying agents without oversight = compliance exposure at scale
- Agentic AI usage rising sharply in next 2 years but oversight lagging
- Deloitte: 42% still developing strategy, 35% have no strategy at all

**Author Angle**: "Our CLAUDE.md is 200 lines of governance — turn limits, file rules, PR review protocols. Not glamorous. But it's why 189 sessions run without chaos. Governance is the unsexy work that makes scale possible."

**Why Works**: Contrarian + insider knowledge + BIP transparency = trust building
**Bucket**: BIP / Authority
**Format**: Short with stats + personal angle

### 4. Contact Center: AI vs AI — Identity Verification Crisis

**Hook**: "AI agents are calling your call center. Using voice synthesis. Bypassing identity checks designed for humans."

**Core Data**:
- AI-to-AI interaction trend: customers using AI agents to navigate IVR/escalation
- More sinister: synthetic audio = AI impersonation in voice channels
- 2026 contact center attack surface expanding with AI adoption
- Identity verification systems built for human behavior patterns — not AI patterns
- CX leaders unprepared: most assume interactions are human-initiated

**Author Angle**: "7 years building call center AI. The attack vector nobody planned for: AI agents calling AI agents. Identity verification was designed for humans. It's not ready for this."

**Why Works**: Novel/alarming angle + insider credibility + timely 2026 data
**Bucket**: Authority
**Format**: Short hook + 2-3 lines of insight, no link

### 5. 324% ROI on Contract Automation — The Specific Case Studies Nobody Shares

**Hook**: "324% ROI. That's contract automation with AI agents. Sirion Labs case study. Here's the math:"

**Core Data**:
- Sirion Labs: 324% ROI on autonomous contract workflow
- McKinsey: 3-15% revenue increase + 10-20% sales ROI from agents
- Customer service: 15-30% productivity gains, some aiming for 80%
- Industrial maintenance: 20% cost savings on equipment (predictive AI agents)
- Manufacturing: 15% uptime improvement

**Author Angle**: "Every ROI stat for agents sounds huge in isolation. The pattern: narrow, well-defined workflows = exceptional ROI. Broad, ambiguous deployments = chaos. That's the real lesson from 7 years in production AI."

**Why Works**: Specific numbers + production insight + contrarian framing
**Bucket**: Authority
**Format**: Short with case study data

### 6. Agentic AI Alliance: Linux Foundation, Open Standards for Agents

**Hook**: "Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, OpenAI all joining Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation. Open standards for AI agents = the TCP/IP moment."

**Core Data**:
- Agentic Artificial Intelligence Foundation (AAIF) backed by Linux Foundation
- All major players: Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, OpenAI joining
- Key initiatives: MCP (Anthropic), Agents.md (OpenAI), Goose (Block)
- 97M+ monthly MCP SDK downloads (Python + TypeScript)
- 75% of gateway vendors integrating MCP by 2026 (Gartner)
- Parallel to how TCP/IP standardized internet protocols

**Author Angle**: "MCP is the plumbing running under this agent. 97M monthly downloads. When all four major AI cos agree on a standard, it's not a feature — it's infrastructure. This is the moment."

**Why Works**: Industry validation + infrastructure angle + specific numbers
**Bucket**: Authority
**Format**: Short with stats + TCP/IP comparison hook

## Content Priority Order (when queues drain)

When BOTH queues drop to ≤15, use SUPPLEMENTAL file Tier 1 first (AI Washing, OpenAI Frontier, Claude Sonnet 4.6 BIP), then cycle through these new angles.

**Tier Priority for this file:**
1. **#1** — Agent Manager career angle (high shareability, BIP validation)
2. **#4** — AI vs AI identity crisis (novel + alarming = high engagement)
3. **#3** — Governance gap (contrarian + insider insight)
4. **#6** — Agentic AI Alliance TCP/IP moment (industry news + infrastructure angle)
5. **#2** — $2.9T McKinsey context (dollar amount + contrarian tension)
6. **#5** — 324% ROI case studies (specific data + production lesson)
