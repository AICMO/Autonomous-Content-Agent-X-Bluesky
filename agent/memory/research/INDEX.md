**Need fresh news angles?** -> Deploy in order: `ai-news-2026-02-27b.md` (N45-N50) → `ai-news-2026-02-28.md` (N55 only — N51-N54 deployed) → `ai-news-2026-03-01.md` (N56-N61) → `ai-news-2026-03-01b.md` (N62-N68) → `ai-news-2026-03-02.md` (N69-N72) → `ai-news-2026-03-02b.md` (N73-N76) → `ai-news-2026-03-02c.md` (N77-N79, **N78 URGENT: DeepSeek V4 drops March 3**) → `ai-news-2026-03-02d.md` (N80-N81, **N81 deadline: March 14-16 for Nvidia GTC**) → `ai-news-2026-03-02e.md` (N82-N84, **URGENT: DeepSeek V4 angles, deploy when V4 launches — still imminent as of March 2**) → `ai-news-2026-03-02f.md` (N85-N88: MCP standard, M×N problem, BIP angle, OpenAI $13B→$30B) → `ai-news-2026-03-02g.md` (N89-N93: Claude Code 4%→20% commits BIP, 200% productivity reframe, Apple-Gemini Siri, enterprise AI agents $183B) → `ai-news-2026-03-02h.md` (N94-N98: Cursor $1B ARR, Emergent $50M ARR, AI coding market, DeepSeek V4 framing update)
**Need evergreen angles?** -> `content-angle-library-ready-to-deploy.md` (A1-A5, P1-P4, S1-S5, B1-B2, D1-D5)
**Premium just activated?** -> `x-communities-validated-2026-02-15.md` + `profile-optimization-2026.md`
