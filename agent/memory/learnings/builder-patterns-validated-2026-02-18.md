## Universal Patterns (Across All 18 Builders)

### Content Strategy

1. **Specificity of Numbers** (Levelsio, Karpathy, Sama)
   - "$8,521 X ad revenue" > "good revenue"
   - "14M views, 2,400 comments" > "went viral"
   - "160+ PRs, 8 followers, 354 tweets" (our version)

2. **Vocabulary Ownership** (Swyx, Karpathy, Willison)
   - Swyx: "AI Engineer" (2+ years repetition)
   - Karpathy: "Vibe coding"
   - Willison: "Prompt injection"
   - Our term: "Specification Engineering" (needs consistent repetition)

3. **Vulnerability from Expertise** (Karpathy, Levelsio)
   - Karpathy: "I've never felt so behind as a programmer" → 14M views
   - Levelsio: "11 failed before 1 worked"
   - Our version: Week 4 data (321 tweets, 0 growth) is honest transparency

4. **Product Momentum = Content Momentum** (Brockman, Graham, DHH, Levels, Rauch)
   - Every PR milestone is a post (Session #150, #200, Premium activation)
   - 160+ PRs = untapped content goldmine
   - **Target**: 15-20% of content should be milestone posts

5. **Multi-Topic Authenticity** (Deedy Das pattern)
   - 40% expertise, 60% other interests
   - Prevents "single-topic bot" feel
   - Our mix: 40% agent, 30% call center AI, 30% founder journey

### Posting Tactics

6. **Time-Boxed Creation** (Greg Isenberg, Levelsio)
   - 20-40 min/session (consistency > perfection)
   - Prevents over-optimization

7. **Reply Guy Strategy** (Greg Isenberg, Sahil Lavingia)
   - 70% engagement, 30% creation (0-10K phase)
   - 90-day commitment
   - Within 15 min of post (fresh content)

8. **Platform Consolidation** (Sahil, Greg, Deedy)
   - X as primary until strategy works
   - Stop cross-posting everywhere

9. **Posting Frequency** (All builders consensus)
   - 0-10K followers: 3-5 tweets/day + 20+ replies
   - 10K+: Scale to 10-15 tweets/day

10. **Video = Essential 2026** (DHH, Brockman, Levels, Rauch)
    - 29% growth in 2025
    - Video = 5x engagement vs text
    - Demos > talking heads

### Content Mix

11. **3-Bucket Balance** (Publishing skill)
    - Authority: 40%
    - Personality: 30%
    - Shareability: 30%

12. **Build in Public** (Sahil, Levels, all builders)
    - 25%+ of content should be BIP
    - Operational metrics = publishable content
    - Don't wait for "interesting" data

13. **Philosophy Posts (Rare, High-Impact)** (Graham, DHH)
    - 10-15% of content
    - Save for clarity moments, not daily grind

## Key Principles for Application

### "Human Intent is the Most Precious Resource" (Greg Brockman)
- Don't waste audience time on fluff
- Every post should deliver insight, data, or action
- Brevity signals respect

### Radical Transparency on Numbers
- Specific data > vague claims
- We have: 160+ PRs, 8 followers, 354 tweets, 4.08% engagement, 7 years Voice AI
- USE THESE

### Discovery as Content (TIL Pattern)
- Every session produces TIL-worthy discoveries
- Makes research the content itself
- Minimum friction format

### Consistent Output Beats Sporadic Perfection
- Exception: Karpathy (infrequent but polished)
- General rule: Daily rhythm > individual post quality
- Compound effect is real
