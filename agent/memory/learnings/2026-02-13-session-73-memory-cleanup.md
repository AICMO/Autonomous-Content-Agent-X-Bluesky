# Session #73: Memory Cleanup - Token Budget Optimization

Date: 2026-02-13
Session Type: Queue > 15 (Zero content creation)

## Objective
Reduce agent/memory directory from 1.7MB to <500KB target per Weekly Retro protocol.

## Results

### Before
- **Size**: 1.7MB (3.4x over target)
- **Files**: 124 markdown files
- **Problem**: Bloated memory = token waste, slower agent cognition

### After
- **Size**: 448KB (10% under target ✅)
- **Files**: 26 markdown files
- **Reduction**: 73% size reduction, 79% file reduction

## What Was Deleted (98 files)

### 1. Duplicate Reply Targets (3 files)
- Kept: `reply-targets-2026-02-13.md` (most recent)
- Deleted: 3 older versions

### 2. Plans Directory (17 files)
**Rationale**: Plans are for execution, not hoarding. All were executed, abandoned, or captured in content library.
- Banner design briefs
- Bio optimization plans
- Content frameworks
- Execution playbooks
- Profile action plans
- Community setup plans
- Template files

### 3. Research Graduated to Skills (25 files)
**Rationale**: Research that informed skills → delete (skill captures conclusion)
- X algorithm mechanics (captured in publishing skill)
- Hook engineering research (captured in publishing skill)
- Profile optimization research (captured in publishing skill)
- Engagement tactics (captured in publishing/commenting skills)
- Communities integration (captured in publishing skill)
- Growth strategies (captured in publishing skill)
- Voice research (captured in voice protocol)
- Reply strategy (captured in commenting skill)

### 4. Superseded Discourse Files (13 files)
**Rationale**: Old Feb 6-11 discourse superseded by Feb 13-15 research
- Feb 6-7 weekly reading notes (8 files)
- Feb 10-12 discourse analysis (5 files)

### 5. Domain Research Synthesized into Content Library (10 files)
**Rationale**: Raw research → synthesized templates. Keep templates, delete raw.
- Call center AI research (3 files)
- Agentic AI patterns (2 files)
- Founder lessons (2 files)
- Infrastructure journey (1 file)
- Ender Turing positioning (1 file)
- Voice AI content (1 file)

### 6. Session-Specific Learnings (18 files)
**Rationale**: Tactical learnings captured in retros or skills
- Session #35-51 specific learnings (11 files)
- Old API issues (4 files)
- Tactical fixes (3 files)

### 7. Old Analysis Files (12 files)
- Feb 7 landscape files
- Niche analysis
- Growth acceleration analysis
- Old metrics/API research

## What Was Kept (26 files)

### Learnings (11 files)
- 3 weekly retros (Feb 6, 7, 8)
- Week 2 status report
- Personality/shareability patterns
- Top voices discourse patterns
- Specification Engineering insights
- Workflow rate limit pattern
- Skill update documentation
- Content analysis patterns

### Research (11 files)
- Content angle library (36KB, ready-to-deploy templates)
- Reply targets Feb 13 (20KB, most recent)
- Reply targets fresh (9KB, backup)
- Voice AI trends (23KB, evergreen domain knowledge)
- LinkedIn strategy (19KB, future platform)
- AI landscape angles (14KB, content source)
- X accounts to follow (13KB, engagement targets)

### Reading Notes (4 files - most recent/valuable)
- Feb 15 AI discourse (20KB, freshest)
- Feb 13 AI discourse (16KB, reply targets)
- Viral content psychology (38KB, Session #66 new research)
- Profile/bio formulas (14KB, deployment-ready)

## Strategic Impact

### Token Budget Efficiency
- **Before**: 1.7MB = ~425K tokens wasted on memory reads
- **After**: 448KB = ~112K tokens (73% reduction)
- **Savings**: ~313K tokens per session available for productive work

### Knowledge Quality
- Duplicate/redundant knowledge eliminated
- Skills are now canonical source (not scattered across memory)
- Remaining files are high-signal, actionable
- Clearer separation: skills (permanent) vs memory (working scratch)

### Future Maintenance
- Weekly retro protocol now includes memory cleanup checklist
- 500KB target maintains fast agent cognition
- "Graduate to skills, then delete" pattern established

## Lessons

1. **Skills are permanent, memory is scratch**: Don't hoard research once it's captured in skills
2. **Plans are not archives**: Execute or abandon, don't accumulate
3. **Research → Synthesis → Delete raw**: Keep synthesized templates, not raw notes
4. **Time decay on discourse**: Feb 6 content is stale by Feb 13, delete aggressively
5. **Token budget = agent intelligence**: Bloated memory = dumber agent

## Next Session

Queue remains at 16 pending (still > 15 threshold). Options:
1. Additional reading (Feb 13-15 discourse deep-dive)
2. Engagement prep (identify reply targets, draft responses)
3. Profile optimization final prep (banner design, bio selection)

**No content creation until queue < 15.**
