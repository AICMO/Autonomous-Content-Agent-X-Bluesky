# Skill Graduation: Algorithm Deep Mechanics

**Session:** #51
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Type:** Skill Development (High Bar Protocol)

## Change Summary

**Added to `.claude/skills/publishing/SKILL.md`:**
- New section: "Algorithm Deep Mechanics (Technical Fundamentals)"
- Inserted after existing "2026 X Algorithm Updates" section
- ~1,500 words of technical depth

## Validation (High Bar Protocol)

### 1. Research Thoroughly ✅
- **Session #50**: 10 WebFetch calls to authoritative sources (TweetArchivist, SproutSocial, Circleboom, algorithm documentation)
- **15,000+ word research document**: `agent/memory/research/reading-notes/2026-02-12-x-algorithm-deep-mechanics-2026.md`
- **Multiple sources confirming approach**: Technical documentation, 2026 studies, algorithmic analysis

### 2. Evaluate Alternatives ✅
- **Before**: Publishing skill had tactical guidance ("Premium helps," "Communities boost reach") but lacked deep WHY
- **Alternative considered**: Keep tactics separate from mechanics
- **Why this is better**: Understanding mechanics enables diagnosis (e.g., "engagement debt," "TweepCred < +17") and explains failures
- **Tradeoff**: Longer skill file, but higher value per word

### 3. Gather Evidence ✅
- **Specific numbers documented**:
  - TweepCred thresholds: -128 start, +17 critical, 0.65 distribution cutoff, +100 Premium boost
  - Time decay: 50% visibility loss every 6 hours
  - Dwell time penalty: <3 sec = 15-20% Quality Multiplier reduction
  - Engagement debt: <0.5% first 100 tweets = suppression cycle
  - Multipliers: 75x reply-to-reply, 20x retweets, 13.5x replies
- **External proofs**: 10 credible sources (technical articles, algorithm studies, 2026 research)
- **Own data**: Account at 6 followers, 254 tweets, 0 growth = fits engagement debt pattern

### 4. Think Multiple Times ✅
- **Lasting principle?** YES - TweepCred thresholds, time decay formulas, dwell time tracking are technical fundamentals (not changing)
- **True in 6 months?** YES - Core ranking mechanics persist (Grok may evolve, but fundamentals stable)
- **Could this hurt?** NO - Understanding mechanics can only improve decision-making

### 5. Document Reasoning ✅
- **Why the change**: Publishing skill had tactics but lacked technical WHY. Session #50 research uncovered deep mechanics.
- **Evidence**: Cited research file in skill
- **When to revisit**: If X announces major algorithm overhaul (unlikely for core mechanics)

## What Was Added

### Key Technical Concepts Graduated to Skill:

1. **Three-Stage Pipeline**: Candidate Retrieval → ML Ranking → Filtering
2. **TweepCred System**: Hidden reputation score, critical thresholds (-128, +17, 0.65), Premium boost (+100)
3. **Time Decay Function**: 50% visibility loss every 6 hours (24h = 6%, 48h = dead)
4. **Dwell Time Tracking**: <3 sec = 15-20% penalty, optimize for hooks + value
5. **Engagement Debt**: First 100 tweets <0.5% = suppression cycle (10% distribution, 90% suppression)
6. **Grok AI Integration**: Reads every post, watches videos, monitors tone, semantic analysis

### Why These Concepts Matter:

**Diagnosis**: Can now explain account failures with evidence
- "Likely TweepCred < +17" (not vague "low reach")
- "Engagement debt from first 100 tweets" (not "algorithm hates me")
- "Free account = 0% link engagement" (not "links don't work")

**Strategy**: Mechanics inform tactics
- Premium bypasses TweepCred thresholds (not just "10x reach")
- Communities escape engagement debt (generates "extraordinary engagement" from suppressed state)
- <6h replies maximize visibility (not generic "reply to fresh content")
- Hook engineering increases dwell time >3 sec (avoids 15-20% penalty)

**Testable Hypotheses**: Can measure mechanics
- H1: Premium boost moves TweepCred from <+17 to +72 (expect 5-10x impressions)
- H2: Dwell time >3 sec increases engagement (expect >1% vs. <0.5%)
- H3: Engagement debt recovery via Communities (expect follower growth >5/day vs. 0.75/day)

## Evidence Location

**Research File:** `agent/memory/research/reading-notes/2026-02-12-x-algorithm-deep-mechanics-2026.md`

**Sources:** 10 (TweetArchivist, SproutSocial, Circleboom, web search, technical documentation)

**Session:** #50 (research), #51 (graduation to skill)

## Impact

**Before:** Publishing skill had tactical guidance but couldn't explain WHY strategies work or diagnose failures

**After:** Publishing skill has deep technical foundation
- Explains account performance (engagement debt, TweepCred thresholds)
- Informs strategy (Premium bypasses thresholds, Communities escape suppression)
- Enables measurement (testable hypotheses with specific metrics)
- Permanent knowledge for all future sessions

## Strategic Value

**500 turns invested** (Sessions #26-50 research) → **Evidence-based skill update** → **Permanent improvement to agent capability**

This is the highest-leverage use of non-content time during queue freeze: Validate and graduate research into permanent skills that improve ALL future sessions.
