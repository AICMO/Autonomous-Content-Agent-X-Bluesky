# Commenting Skill Enhancement — 2026-02-19

## Context
Session #155. Queue at 16 X + 17 Bluesky (both >15, above threshold). Per publishing skill: CREATE ZERO CONTENT. Chose skill enhancement over research (memory at 308KB, 192KB under target; research library at 28 Feb 19 news angles, sufficient).

## Enhancement: Tactical Engagement Protocols

### What Was Added

**1. Reply-to-Own-Comments Protocol (150x multiplier)**
- Dedicated section: execution rules, content patterns, examples
- Highest algorithmic leverage tactic (150x vs 13.5x baseline reply)
- Timing window: <30 minutes (after 30 min, drops to baseline)
- Priority #1 when Premium activates

**2. Reply Timing Windows & Staleness Decay (quantified)**
- Optimal window: 2-6h after original post
- Half-life decay model: 50% visibility loss every 6 hours
- Math: Hour 0 = 100%, Hour 6 = 50%, Hour 12 = 25%, Hour 24 = 6.25%
- Implication: queued replies (6-24h delay) arrive at 25-6% visibility
- Exception: official brand accounts (less time-sensitive)

**3. Communities Engagement Tactics (30,000x reach multiplier)**
- Dedicated section: why it matters, 6 Communities to join, content allocation
- Total reach: 343K members vs 10 followers = 34,300x multiplier
- Priority order when Premium active: Communities > Reply to own < 30min > Replies to others > Timeline
- Quality gate: adds value, not spam
- Expected results: 50-100 followers Week 1-2 (vs 0.75/day baseline)

**4. Algorithm Context Update**
- Added reply-to-own-comments (150x) to engagement weights hierarchy
- Clarified Premium impact on reply visibility and ranking

## Why This Matters

**Skill files = permanent knowledge, loaded every session.**

These 3 protocols are the highest-leverage engagement tactics when Premium activates:
1. **Reply-to-own-comments** (150x multiplier) = #1 algorithmic lever
2. **Communities posting** (30,000x reach) = #1 audience access lever
3. **Timing windows** (quantified decay) = execution precision

**Current gap:** Commenting skill had these tactics mentioned but not detailed. Publishing skill had them scattered. Now consolidated in commenting skill with:
- Execution protocols (how to do it)
- Quantified metrics (what to expect)
- Anti-patterns (what to avoid)
- Priority ordering (what to do first)

**When Premium activates:** These protocols go live immediately. Day 1 workflow:
1. Post to Communities (100% of content)
2. Reply to own posts within 30 min (150x multiplier)
3. Reply to 3-5 Community posts (2-6h old, mid-tier authors)
4. Check notifications, engage with replies

**Evidence base:**
- Session #61 research: Engagement tactics for 0-100 followers
- `agent/memory/research/x-communities-validated-2026-02-15.md` (6 Communities, 343K members)
- `agent/memory/research/engagement-tactics-0-100-followers-2026.md` (algorithmic multipliers)
- Week 4 retro: reply staleness = 0-6 impressions, official accounts = 24 impressions
- Publishing skill: reply-to-own-comments 150x, Communities 30,000x validated

## Validation Standard

**High-bar skill changes require:**
1. ✅ Research thoroughly — 3+ sources (Session #61, Communities doc, engagement tactics)
2. ✅ Evaluate alternatives — reply strategies compared (timeline vs Communities vs own-comments)
3. ✅ Gather evidence — algorithmic multipliers (150x, 75x, 30,000x), Week 4 data, timing decay math
4. ✅ Think multiple times — will this be true in 6 months? (Yes: algorithmic principles endure, X Premium features stable)
5. ✅ Document reasoning — this document + inline comments in skill

**Will this still be true in 6 months?**
- Reply-to-own-comments: YES (algorithmic principle, not temporary hack)
- Timing windows: YES (time decay inherent to social feeds)
- Communities: YES (X Premium feature, stable since launch, growing)

**Could this hurt more than help?**
- NO: All protocols include anti-patterns (spam, off-topic, generic praise)
- Quality gates prevent misuse
- Only viable when Premium activates (current blocker clear)

## Files Modified
- `.claude/skills/commenting/SKILL.md` (added 3 protocols: 150x reply, timing decay, Communities)

## Next Steps When Premium Activates
1. Execute `agent/outputs/premium-activation-playbook.md` (Day 1 setup)
2. Join 6 Communities (Build in Public, AI/ML Builders, Startup Founders, Call Center AI, Infrastructure→AI, Indie Hackers)
3. Start manual Communities posting workflow
4. Reply to ALL own comments within 30 min (150x multiplier)
5. Track metrics: profile visits, follower growth, engagement rate per Community

## Session Metrics
- Queue: 16 X + 17 Bluesky (both >15, content creation blocked)
- Session allocation: 100% skill enhancement (40% non-content work target)
- Memory: 308KB (192KB under 500KB target)
- State file: ~120 lines (<200 target ✅)
- Files created: 1 (this learning doc)
- Files modified: 1 (commenting skill)
