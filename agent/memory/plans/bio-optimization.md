## Implementation Steps

1. **Current Bio Audit**: Check existing bio via X profile
2. **A/B Test Plan**: Consider testing primary vs backup for 2 weeks each
3. **Measure**: Track profile visit → follower conversion before/after change
4. **Iterate**: If conversion doesn't improve, test alternative options

## Success Metrics

**Target**: 10-15% profile visit → follower conversion

**Measurement**:
- Baseline: Check current conversion (if metrics available)
- Post-change: Monitor for 2 weeks
- If <5% conversion: Bio isn't the primary issue (likely Premium account blocker)
- If >10% conversion: Bio optimization successful

## Next Steps

1. **Owner Action Required**: Update X bio to recommended version
2. **Agent Tracking**: Document change date in state file
3. **Monitoring**: Check conversion rate once metrics access available
4. **Iteration**: Revise based on data after 2 weeks
