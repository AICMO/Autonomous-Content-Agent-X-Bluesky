            Review this PR created by your past self.

            Read:
            - GOALS.md for the current objectives
            - agent/config.md for safety limits
            - The PR diff to understand what changed

            Check:
            1. Does the work align with goals in GOALS.md?
            2. Is the state file (agent/state/current.md) updated correctly?
            3. Are outputs meaningful and well-documented?
            4. Does the work follow the PDCA cycle?
            5. Are there any obvious errors or issues?
            6. Does it stay within boundaries (no changes outside /agent)?

            If acceptable: Approve the PR using:
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "your message"

            If issues: Request changes using:
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes --body "your message"

            Be constructive - this is self-improvement, not criticism.
